#### Improvements:

* Improved Content Language selection ordering in Awareness Educator > Send Training by sorting available languages alphabetically, so admins can find and select the desired content language faster and experience a more consistent and predictable selection flow.
* Improved Direct Email Creation (DEC) error messages across Awareness Educator and DEC-enabled modules by validating domain selection before sending and displaying clearer, actionable error messages, so admins can immediately understand why a delivery failed and resolve domain configuration issues without confusion or unnecessary support tickets.
* Improved Phishing Scenario preview for multi-language landing page templates by ensuring merge tags (such as user name fields) are correctly resolved in all supported languages, not only the company’s preferred language, so admins can accurately preview localized landing pages without missing or empty placeholders.
* Improved simulation email template import handling to prevent unnecessary HTML duplication during repeated imports, eliminating redundant \<div> nesting, reducing code bloat, and ensuring imported templates remain clean, performant, and visually consistent across multiple save or import actions.

#### Bug Fixes:

* Fixed an issue where system reminder emails were not sent to users in Awareness Educator trainings, even when reminder settings were enabled, ensuring reminder emails are now delivered correctly based on the configured schedule and completion conditions.
* Fixed an issue where users could access and complete trainings while the email delivery status was still “Queued” or failed, which caused reporting inconsistencies and missing activity timeline logs, ensuring trainings become accessible only after valid delivery and user activities are now logged correctly.
* Fixed an issue where values entered in IP Addresses, URLs, and Attachments fields were not saved in Incident Responder > Integrations > Advanced Settings, including Batch Import entries, ensuring all manually added and bulk-imported data is now persisted correctly after saving.
* Fixed an issue in the Security Growth Dashboard user info endpoint by adding proper null checks when the target user record is missing, ensuring deleted target users are handled correctly and receive an appropriate unauthorized response instead of unknown errors.
* Fixed inaccurate status, progress calculation, and error messaging in the Job Log page by correctly reflecting completed and failed processes, capping progress at 100%, and displaying real failure reasons only when jobs are genuinely stuck or errored, ensuring users can clearly understand job outcome.
* Fixed an issue where setting a default filter in the Trash tab also affected the Enrollments tab in Awareness Educator, ensuring filters applied in Trash no longer impact active enrollment listings and each tab now preserves its own independent filter state.
* Fixed an issue where “Set as default filter” stopped applying correctly when switching tabs in Simulation and Training Reports, ensuring saved default filters are consistently applied to both the filter interface and report data after page refreshes or tab changes.
* Fixed an issue where adding a second page to landing page templates triggered a “Landing page orders need to be unique” error, ensuring multi-page landing pages can now be created and saved successfully across phishing scenarios and data submission templates.
* Fixed an issue where the “Create Scenario” button was incorrectly positioned on the Campaign Manager > Training tab when using the AI Ally scenario selection, causing confusion in the training configuration flow.
