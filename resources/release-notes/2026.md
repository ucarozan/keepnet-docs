#### New Features:

* Added Monthly Users widgets in Company > Target Users, which displays the total number of unique users included in the selected billing month regardless of their current status (Active, Inactive, or Deleted), allowing MSSPs to clearly track billable user counts and use this view as an auditable reference for monthly billing.
* Added Security Culture Score (Survey Gauge) widget to Reports > Executive Reports, visualizing the organization’s overall security culture as a single, participant-weighted survey score, with trend vs previous period and industry benchmark comparison for quick executive-level insight.
* Added Target Group visibility in Phishing Campaign Reports so each campaign report tab (e.g., Clicked, Opened, Data Submitted, No Response, etc.) now shows which selected target group(s) a user belongs to from the groups chosen when the campaign was launched. Admins can open the Groups field to view the exact group names, making it easier to review results by groups without manual cross-checking.

#### Improvements:

* Improved Company > Target Users search and sorting behavior by enabling proper sorting when filtering users with “Deleted” status, ensuring deleted users are now listed and ordered correctly alongside other statuses when sorting is applied.
* Improved Company > Target Users sorting by fixing an issue where sorting/filtering by UpdateTime (Status Updated) failed, ensuring users can now reliably sort the Target Users list by the latest update time without errors.
* Improved Safari browser behavior to ensure the correct company-specific favicon is displayed on browser tabs when switching between different customers, preventing previously visited customer icons from appearing incorrectly and providing a consistent, accurate brand experience across company switches.
* Improved Company creation by automatically setting the default Date Format and Time Format based on the selected Country, while still allowing admins to manually override these formats when needed, so companies start with the correct regional formatting and avoid inconsistent date/time display.
* Improved Incident Responder > Manual Investigation filtering by renaming the “URL” filter to “Domain” and keeping the placeholder aligned with domain-only input, so users clearly understand the filter expects a domain value and avoid failed searches caused by past label confusion.

#### Bug Fixes:

* Fixed an issue in phishing campaigns using the “Start Training Immediately” option where users clicking the “Start Training” button on the landing page were shown a “This training is not available for you” error, even though the training was correctly assigned.
* Fixed an issue in Company > Companies where the column renamed to “License Limit” in the UI was still exported as “User Limit” in downloaded reports (PDF/CSV/Excel), ensuring column names are now consistent between the interface and exported files.
* Fixed an issue in Campaign Reports (Opened, Opened Attachment, and No Response tabs) where exported reports did not correctly list all Target Groups for users who belonged to multiple groups, ensuring all associated groups are now fully and consistently included in downloaded files.
* Fixed an issue in Awareness Educator > Training Library where duplicating a training assigned to multiple roles failed with a “Training role not found” error, ensuring multi-role training content can now be duplicated successfully.
* Fixed an issue in Smishing Simulator > Smishing Report where the associated training name was displayed as “undefined” in phishing-related reports, ensuring the correct training name is now shown consistently across smishing and phishing report views.

#### Improvements:

* Improved Content Language selection ordering in Awareness Educator > Send Training by sorting available languages alphabetically, so admins can find and select the desired content language faster and experience a more consistent and predictable selection flow.
* Improved Direct Email Creation (DEC) error messages across Awareness Educator and DEC-enabled modules by validating domain selection before sending and displaying clearer, actionable error messages, so admins can immediately understand why a delivery failed and resolve domain configuration issues without confusion or unnecessary support tickets.
* Improved Phishing Scenario preview for multi-language landing page templates by ensuring merge tags (such as user name fields) are correctly resolved in all supported languages, not only the company’s preferred language, so admins can accurately preview localized landing pages without missing or empty placeholders.
* Improved simulation email template import handling to prevent unnecessary HTML duplication during repeated imports, eliminating redundant \<div> nesting, reducing code bloat, and ensuring imported templates remain clean, performant, and visually consistent across multiple save or import actions.

#### Bug Fixes:

* Fixed an issue where system reminder emails were not sent to users in Awareness Educator trainings, even when reminder settings were enabled, ensuring reminder emails are now delivered correctly based on the configured schedule and completion conditions.
* Fixed an issue where users could access and complete trainings while the email delivery status was still “Queued” or failed, which caused reporting inconsistencies and missing activity timeline logs, ensuring trainings become accessible only after valid delivery and user activities are now logged correctly.
* Fixed an issue where values entered in IP Addresses, URLs, and Attachments fields were not saved in Incident Responder > Integrations > Advanced Settings, including Batch Import entries, ensuring all manually added and bulk-imported data is now persisted correctly after saving.
* Fixed an issue in the Security Growth Dashboard user info endpoint by adding proper null checks when the target user record is missing, ensuring deleted target users are handled correctly and receive an appropriate unauthorized response instead of unknown errors.
* Fixed inaccurate status, progress calculation, and error messaging in the Job Log page by correctly reflecting completed and failed processes, capping progress at 100%, and displaying real failure reasons only when jobs are genuinely stuck or errored, ensuring users can clearly understand job outcome.
* Fixed an issue where setting a default filter in the Trash tab also affected the Enrollments tab in Awareness Educator, ensuring filters applied in Trash no longer impact active enrollment listings and each tab now preserves its own independent filter state.
* Fixed an issue where “Set as default filter” stopped applying correctly when switching tabs in Simulation and Training Reports, ensuring saved default filters are consistently applied to both the filter interface and report data after page refreshes or tab changes.
* Fixed an issue where adding a second page to landing page templates triggered a “Landing page orders need to be unique” error, ensuring multi-page landing pages can now be created and saved successfully across phishing scenarios and data submission templates.
* Fixed an issue where the “Create Scenario” button was incorrectly positioned on the Campaign Manager > Training tab when using the AI Ally scenario selection, causing confusion in the training configuration flow.
