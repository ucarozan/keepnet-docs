#### New Features:

* Added **Phishing Activity** and **Training Activity** widgets under **Reports > Executive Reports > Manager Metrics**, including a **linked data table** and **scheduled Excel (.xlsx)** export, so admins can report both phishing and training activity of their employees in Executive Reports and share the results in a structured, downloadable format automatically to the employee’s manager directly.
* Added **Manager** and **Manager Email** columns to **Company > Target Users**, so admins can store manager details per user and use them in the **Manager Reporting** feature.
* Added the **Real Phishing Defender** badge to the **Security Growth Employee Dashboard**, so employees can see recognition on their dashboard when they successfully report real phishing emails and stay motivated through visible progress and achievements.
* Added the **Training Streak** badge to the **Security Growth Employee Dashboard**, so employees can earn recognition for consistent learning progress as they complete trainings in a row.
* Added a **Preferred Language** column to **Reports > Gamification Report > Leaderboard**, so admins can view each employee’s preferred language directly in the dashboard when reviewing performance and rankings.
* Added **Direct Email Creation (DEC)** as an **Email Delivery** option for **Incident Responder** notification templates, so admins can send Incident Responder notifications through DEC instead of SMTP and deliver them directly into users’ mailboxes.
* Introduced **AI Ally-assisted Description generation** to **Awareness Educator** when creating a training, adding an **Improve with AI** action next to the **Description** field that can automatically generate suggested text and allow users to preview the recommendation before applying it.

#### Improvements:

* Improved the **Bot Activity** feature in **Phishing Simulator** click tracking, so that automated bot/sandbox traffic is identified more reliably and campaign reports reflect **cleaner, more accurate user activity data**.
* Improved the email delivery **Error** **details**, where a system admin can see more details of the failed email delivered for their training email delivery to the employees on the **Enrollment** report on the **Sending** **Report** menu.
* When a **Smart Group** is selected while launching a training, an info banner/card is shown on the Target Audience and Summary steps to clearly state that users may be automatically removed if they no longer meet the criteria, and therefore won’t receive the **next training**—preventing confusion and wrong expectations.
* Improved **Phishing Simulator > Phishing Scenarios > Landing Pages** for Just-in-time (Red Flag) learning pages by ensuring the **Email Preview** automatically renders for the template selected in the scenario (including its available localized language versions), allowing admins to verify how the experience will look before launching a phishing campaign.
* Improved **Incident Responder > Investigations > Manual Investigation > Filters** by aligning the URL filter label and placeholder with its actual behavior, so users clearly understand whether the filter expects a Domain or a Full URL and can apply the correct input without confusion when searching investigation data.
* Improved **Awareness Educator > Surveys > Reports** by redesigning the Result Preview / User Details view as a drawer instead of a modal, providing a more consistent layout for long surveys and preventing display issues such as misaligned questions, broken frames, or content not fitting on the screen when previewing user responses.
* Improved **Company > Company Settings >** **Notification Templates > Preview** by redesigning the preview experience as a drawer instead of a modal, providing a more consistent and spacious layout for reviewing notification content (including localized versions) without layout or frame issues.
* Improved **Incident Responder > Reported Emails > Analysis Details** by removing the See Details action for the USTA integration in both the URL and Attachment analysis results, preventing users from being redirected to an inaccessible external address while keeping the remaining analysis results visible in the list.
* Improved **Awareness Educator > Training Library** by updating the default sorting to Created Date: Newest to Oldest, ensuring the most recently added trainings appear first and making it easier for users to discover and prioritize the latest content without manually changing the sort option.
* Improved **Target Users > SCIM** provisioning by ensuring users can be created and synced successfully even when department or group names include special characters (such as apostrophes), preventing errors and allowing organizations to keep their original naming conventions without breaking SCIM sync.
* Improved **Incident Responder > Integrations > Advanced Settings > IP Addresses** by introducing system-wide IP exclusions and pre-populating three default IP addresses for all existing and newly created companies, helping prevent false positive detections for trusted Keepnet-related traffic while ensuring system-wide exclusions cannot be edited or removed by end users.
* Improved the Company creation experience by automatically selecting the appropriate **Date Format** and **Time Format** based on the chosen **Country**, reducing configuration mistakes and ensuring companies start with the correct regional settings while still allowing admins to adjust formats manually if needed.

#### Bug Fixes:

* Fixed an issue in **Phishing Simulator > AI Ally** where some recipients could incorrectly receive a Turkish phishing scenario even when the company and target user details were configured in English and the user had no Preferred Language set, ensuring AI Ally now selects scenarios more consistently based on the intended language settings.
* Fixed an issue in **Phishing Simulator > AI Ally** where, in Hyper-Personalization campaigns, the distributed scenarios did not consistently match users’ Department information, ensuring AI Ally now selects and sends scenarios aligned with the intended department-based personalization logic.
* Fixed an issue in **Phishing Simulator > AI Ally** where, in Hyper-Personalization campaigns, the distributed scenarios did not consistently align with users’ Phone Number data, ensuring AI Ally now selects scenarios according to the intended phone number–based personalization logic.
* Fixed an issue in **Phishing Simulator > AI Ally** campaigns where the number of sent target users could be inconsistent and some recipients were not included in delivery, ensuring AI Ally campaigns now send to the full intended target user list and show accurate recipient counts.
* Fixed an issue in **Phishing Simulator > AI Ally** where the “different scenario for each user” option did not work as expected and multiple users could receive the same scenario, ensuring AI Ally now correctly assigns unique scenarios per recipient when this option is selected.
* Fixed an issue in **Phishing Simulator > Campaign Reports > Summary** where campaigns launched with AI Ally could show a blank Difficulty value even when a difficulty level was selected, ensuring the campaign summary now displays the correct difficulty information.
* Fixed an issue in **Security Growth Dashboard** where certificate exam status and action buttons did not correctly follow the certificate’s First Attempt / Any Attempt rules, causing some users to see the wrong status (for example still showing Exam Failed after passing) or irrelevant actions; the dashboard now updates the status correctly and shows only the appropriate actions (including **Download** when a certificate is earned).
* Fixed an issue in **Incident Responder** Playbook Rule Edit where the “Attachment Hash” condition operator was displayed incorrectly in the UI (showing “Is Equal To” even when “Is Not Equal To” was selected), ensuring the correct operator is shown when editing the rule.
* Fixed an issue in **Awareness Educator** content creation (Infographic, Survey, Poster, Screensaver) where items could be saved **without selecting a** **required** “**Vendor**”, ensuring the **Vendor field is enforced before saving**.

#### New Features:

* [Added localization](../../next-generation-product/platform/phishing-simulator/phishing-campaign-manager.md#how-to-launch-scenarios-based-on-users-preferred-language), multi-language support to **Phishing Simulator > Landing Pages** so that admins can create a single landing page with multiple localized versions, ensuring each employee sees the page in their own language while preserving the same localization behavior already used in Email Templates.
* Introduced the **My Security Growth Dashboard** page, enabling employees to view their own training statistics alongside selected company-wide metrics, so they can track their missed training enrollments, learning progress over time and stay motivated to complete required trainings.
* Added localization for all training-related enrollment and reminder notification emails based on each user’s Preferred Language, so multi-language customers can automatically send Training Enrollment, Poster/Infographic, Learning Path, and Survey enrollment notifications in each employee's own language without any manual translation.

#### Improvements:

* Added “**Hospitality**” as a selectable Industry value on the company creation page and in the companies industry filter, so organizations in the hospitality sector can be created, managed, and reported on using the correct industry classification.
* Improved stability in **Phishing Simulator > Email Templates** when editing templates that include a Company Preferred Language, so removing the Company Preferred Language no longer creates duplicate language entries and users can safely delete remaining localized languages without encountering HTTP 500 errors.
* Improved the **Scenarios** page, so that users without edit permissions now see a **Duplicate** button instead of edit for Email Template or Landing Pages menu, allowing them to copy an existing template and start a new draft via the duplicate flow without requiring full edit access.
* Enhanced the **Landing Page Editor** by adding **User Language {USERLANGUAGE}** and **User Department {USERDEPARTMENT}** to the **Merge Tags menu**, allowing users to insert these personalization fields directly from the editor.
* Improved **Awareness Educator > Enrollments > View Report > Sending Report** menu so that the latest error messages related to email delivery are now shown in the **Last Sending Status** tooltip, allowing admins to quickly understand why enrollment emails failed.

#### Bug Fixes:

* Fixed an issue in **Phishing Simulator > Campaign Manager** where using an **invalid Frequency** value when scheduling recurring campaigns could create an excessive number of campaign instances; the system now validates Frequency and only allows values 0–4 (OneTime, Weekly, BiWeekly, Monthly, Quarterly) to prevent unintended mass campaign creation.
* Fixed an issue in **Incident Responder > Zen Spamhaus** integration where lookups for **IPv6 IP** addresses incorrectly returned an **Invalid Domain Name error** and showed the integration as failed, even though Zen Spamhaus reported the IP as valid; IPv6 results are now processed correctly and displayed consistently in the UI.
* Fixed an issue in **Target Users > SCIM sync** where users’ Preferred Language (BCP 47) values were not being written to the **Preferred Language column** after provisioning; the attribute is now correctly updated and visible for all synced users.
* Fixed an issue in **Awareness Educator > Training Library > Grid View** where the **Sort By** control (including the default New to Old option) did not correctly order items and only a subset of trainings were shown; the grid now loads all relevant trainings and applies the selected sort consistently.

<summary>28 November</summary>

#### New Features:

* Added **{USERLANGUAGE}** and **{USERDEPARTMENT}** merge tags to **Landing Page templates** so content can be personalized with each target user’s **preferred language** and **department**; values are populated from **user profiles** (defaulting to **"en"** when no language is set), and the **preview** now correctly resolves the language value for easier testing.
* Added the **Training Vendor** field to **Poster, Infographic, and Screensaver** training types so these assets can be **tagged by vendor** and more easily located in the **training catalog**.
* Added a **Send Us a Copy** option to **Phishing Reporter settings** so customers can control whether **real (non-simulation) emails** reported by employees are **forwarded to Keepnet** for analysing and response.
* Added support for sending **training enrollment notification emails** in each user’s **Preferred Language**, so all enrollment or reminder emails are automatically **localized to the learner’s own language** without manual translation.

#### Improvements:

* Updated **Awareness Educator > Enrollment Reports** so the **Summary** tab now clearly indicates whether **Company Language** or **Target Users’ Preferred Language** is used for the training delivery.
* Updated **Reports > Gamification Report Timeline** so that trainings whose **enrollments have been deleted and moved to Trash** are no longer displayed or counted in **timeline metrics**.
* Updated **Reports > Gamification Report Timeline** so that when a training’s **category** is changed, all related **enrollments and timeline entries** now automatically display the **new category**.
* Updated **Phishing Simulator > Campaign Manager** so that the **Target Users** column count is automatically **recalculated** whenever campaigns are **saved, scheduled, or target groups are modified**, ensuring the list view always reflects the **actual number of recipients** before launch.
* Updated **Email Threat Simulator** scan reports so the **Sent Attacks** menu and its downloads now include the **SHA256** column, making it easier for security teams to reuse file hashes in downstream **security controls**.
* Updated **Callback Simulator** license validation so that companies with an **active Callback Simulator license** and at least **one configured callback phone number** can adjust their license settings without encountering the **“Insufficient callback phone numbers”** error.
* Updated **Phishing Simulator email templates** so that templates used in **active campaigns** can no longer have their **language removed**, preserving consistent language data across **Email Templates** and **campaign reports**.
* Updated **Phishing Simulator campaign report exports** so that the downloaded **Excel file** now includes **custom column fields**, allowing customers to analyse and segment results by their own **custom fields** in exported files.
* Updated **Phishing Simulator > Email Templates** localization so that **unused localized languages** can be removed, allowing authors to **clean up language variants** they no longer need for the email templates.
* Updated **Awareness Educator** tables (**Training Library, Enrollments, Certificates**) so the **“X item(s) selected”** bar now includes an **Unselect All** action and correctly **clears selections** when filters are changed or **Select All** is toggled off.

#### Bug Fixes:

* Fixed an issue in **Awareness Educator > Enrollment reports** where the **search** function in the **Microsoft Teams Notifications** tab under the **Sending Report** menu did not work; it now correctly **filters notification records**.
* Fixed an issue in **Phishing Simulator** where selecting **multiple languages** in the **Scenarios** and **Email Templates** lists returned no results; the **Languages filter** now correctly shows items that match **any of the selected languages**.
* Fixed an issue in **Phishing Simulator campaign reports** where **DEC-initiated campaigns** showed an empty **Opened Email** tab even though users had opened the email; the **Opened** view now correctly lists all users who opened the message.
* Fixed an issue in **Phishing Simulator campaign report exports** where the **Campaign Report** downloaded from the **Summary** tab did not include the **Preferred Language** column; the export now contains this column in line with other report tabs.
* Fixed an issue in the **Phishing Simulator > Scenarios** page where the newly added **Roles** column was not included in **exported reports**; the Roles column now appears correctly in all **scenario report exports**.
* Fixed an issue in **Phishing Simulator campaign reports** where the newly added **Roles** column was not included in **exported files**; the Roles column now appears correctly in all **campaign report exports**.
* Updated **Landing Page Template bot activity integration** so that scripts are now loaded from **embedded HTML resources** instead of inline strings, with unused **Sentry scripts removed** and **preload URL** handling refined for more reliable behavior.
* Fixed an issue in **Awareness Educator > Training Enrollment Sending Report** where the **Email Delivery** column appeared blank; the correct **delivery method** is now displayed for all records.
* Fixed an issue in **Awareness Educator > Training Library** where filters continued to use the previous **AND logic** after **Clear All**; results now correctly follow the selected **AND/OR operator**.
* Fixed an issue in **Phishing Simulator campaign scheduling** where **invalid frequency values greater than 4** were accepted and could generate an excessive number of **recurring campaigns**; the API now **validates frequency values** and blocks unsupported options.
* Fixed an issue where **Fast Launch phishing campaigns** in **Phishing Simulator > Scenarios** for companies under a **reseller** could still use **Keepnet Default SMTP** instead of the reseller’s configured **SMTP**; campaigns now correctly send via the **reseller SMTP** when **“Only Reseller’s SMTP Settings”** is selected in the customer company settings.

<summary>12 November</summary>

#### New Features:

* Added a new **Roles** field to **Phishing Simulator > Phishing Scenarios** that uses the same role list as Awareness Educator (e.g., All Employees, New Employees, Finance Department, Human Resources Department). Scenario authors can now select the target audience by role, see these roles in the **Roles** column of the scenarios list, and filter scenarios based on roles to quickly find and run content tailored to specific user groups.

#### Improvements:

* Improved the **SCORM architecture** so that Keepnet now fully supports receiving and processing additional status values such as incomplete and complete, in addition to existing states. This ensures more accurate tracking of learner progress and reliable certificate delivery across different LMS and SCORM implementations.
* Updated **Phishing Simulator** campaign reports to include a **Scenario Language** column next to Scenario Name. This makes it easier to see which language each scenario was delivered in and improves tracking and reporting accuracy for both single-language and multi-language campaigns.
* Improved the sorting logic in **Phishing Simulator** data tables (Scenarios, Email Templates, Landing Pages) so that content is prioritized by language. Items whose primary language matches the company language appear first, followed by items that include the company language as a secondary language, and then all other languages. Sorting is consistent across all lists and remains intact when filters are applied, helping customers quickly find high-quality content in their own language.
* Updated **Vishing Simulator** campaign reports (Users tab) so that calls reaching a **Busy** state are displayed directly in the Status column, with a tooltip explaining that the number is unavailable or on another call. This provides clearer visibility into why certain users could not be reached.
* Improved attachment-based phishing campaigns so that tracking links now respect each simulation domain’s **URL schema (HTTP or HTTPS)**. This prevents SSL certificate issues on HTTP-only domains while preserving existing tracking functionality, ensuring that attachment reports work reliably across all configured domains.
* Enhanced the **MFA scenario flow** in **Quishing Simulator** so that when users create or duplicate an MFA-type scenario and click **Next** on the Landing Page step, the system clearly indicates that MFA configuration is required and automatically redirects to the **MFA Settings** screen. This guided flow prevents incomplete setups and ensures MFA scenarios are configured correctly before proceeding.
* Improved the backend handling of **SMS-delivered training links** so that enrolled users no longer encounter the “Training is not available for you” message unexpectedly. Target users can now access their assigned training directly from SMS links without errors.
* Updated **license usage calculations** so that only **ACTIVE Target Users** are included. Users marked as INACTIVE are excluded from license counts and are only counted again if reactivated, helping customers avoid paying for unused seats.
* Adjusted the **license-limit warning pop-up** so it is shown at most once per day while the company is over the license limit and is automatically removed once usage returns to or below the limit. This eliminates the need for a “Remind me later” option and reduces user annoyance.
* Added a **SHA256** column in **Email Threat Simulator > Attack Vectors** and included this value in exports. Security teams can now easily retrieve and share file hashes with endpoint and gateway solutions (e.g., AV, EDR, firewalls) to block known threats across their environment.
* Added a new **Test Setup** action under **Company > Company Settings > Microsoft Teams Settings** that sends a real Teams notification using the configured integration. This allows administrators to verify app permissions and Teams policy setup end-to-end directly from the settings screen.

#### Bug Fixes:

* Resolved an issue in **Awareness Educator > Training Library** where sorting materials by **Languages (Preferred Language)** was lost when switching between tabs (e.g., All Types, Learning Path, Training). Sorting is now retained across tab changes, ensuring consistent views and easier discovery of content in the desired language.
* Fixed an issue in **Awareness Educator** where survey items inside a **Learning Path** were incorrectly labeled as Training in the Learning Path Preview. Survey steps now display the correct **Survey** type, ensuring accurate visibility of content types for each step.
* Resolved an issue in **Awareness Educator > Training Library** where content was not ordered according to the company’s **Preferred Language** setting and mixed languages (e.g., English and Turkish) appeared together. Listings now respect the Preferred Language configuration across all customers, ensuring a cleaner and more relevant training catalog.
* Fixed an issue in **Awareness Educator > Training Library** where filters using the **AND** operator (e.g., language + vendor) did not narrow results as expected. Search now correctly returns only trainings that match all selected criteria.
* Fixed an issue in **Awareness Educator > Training Library** where using the **Tags** column with the **Not Equal** filter did not return trainings with no tags. Filter results now correctly include all items that do not contain the selected tag, including records where the Tags field is empty.
* Fixed an issue where **LMS (SCORM Proxy)** deliveries did not display training events in the **Gamification Timeline** because “email opened” and “clicked link” values were null. Timeline entries are now shown based on training activity alone, so LMS users correctly see events such as Email Sent, Training Completed, and Exam Passed/Failed.
* Fixed an issue in **Incident Responder > Playbooks** where the **Target Users** field (Specific user) was cleared after saving and re-editing a rule. The selected user or users now remain visible and correctly saved whenever the playbook is edited.
* Fixed an issue on **Company > New Company** where the **Preferred Language** was not correctly aligned with the selected country (e.g., United States and Canada defaulting to the wrong English variant). Country selection now automatically maps to the appropriate locale-specific language.
* Resolved an issue in **Phishing Simulator** campaign reports where filtering on custom columns (such as **employeeNo**) under the **Submitted Data** tab returned no results. Column filters now work correctly for all custom fields across Opened, Clicked, Submitted Data, No Response, Sending Report, and Reporter views.
* Fixed an issue in **Smishing Simulator** where SMS templates using Cyrillic-based languages such as **Kyrgyz, Bulgarian, and Russian** could result in empty messages on recipient devices. Encoding and data-coding have been aligned with Unicode requirements so that messages are now delivered correctly for these alphabets.
* Fixed a performance issue on the **Just-in-Time Learning** page where embedded email template content could take several minutes to load. The template now appears quickly when the page is opened.

* The Hyper-Personalization dropdown under Phishing Simulator > Campaign Settings now supports longer language names such as Korean (Republic of Korea), ensuring full visibility without truncation.
* When Learning Paths are sent via Microsoft Teams, notifications now include step progress (e.g., Step 1/5). This makes it easier for users to track their training sequence directly from Teams.

#### Bug Fixes:

* Resolved an issue in Awareness Educator > Enrollments > Training Report > Sending Report > Reminder Emails where the page failed to load and user data was not displayed.
* Fixed an issue in Certificate Emails where search results displayed inconsistently across pagination settings. Results are now reliable for all “Rows per page” options.
* Fixed an issue where Learning Path Enrollment reports only displayed the first language. All languages defined in the Learning Path now appear correctly across all reports.
* Fixed an issue where users could progress to the next step in a Learning Path without completing the previous step. The sequence rule is now correctly enforced to preserve training structure.
* Fixed an issue under Company > Companies > Company Groups where search results did not match the total item count and pagination controls were inactive. The list now accurately reflects all records.
* Fixed an issue preventing Reminder Emails from being sent to users who clicked a phishing link or submitted data but hadn’t completed their assigned training. Emails are now correctly triggered based on completion status.

Training materials are now prioritized according to the organization’s defined language preferences, ensuring users view content in their preferred language first and experience a smoother workflow.
* Enhanced the Awareness Educator module to prevent duplicate enrollments that are auto-enroll feature enabled and users who synced via SCIM before and deleted and synced again in the future. The system now ensures that users are not re-enrolled multiple times and that those who have completed training no longer receive unnecessary reminder emails, improving reporting accuracy and user experience.
* Improved the Landing Page Editor to display the actual company logo instantly in the GrapesJS editor instead of showing the {COMPANYLOGO} merge tag. When saved, the logo is automatically stored as {COMPANYLOGO} in the backend, ensuring both real-time visibility and consistent data handling.

#### Bug Fixes:

* Resolved an issue causing inconsistencies and delays in scheduled campaign deliveries. All targeted users now receive planned phishing simulations on time and in full, ensuring accurate reporting and reliable campaign performance tracking.
