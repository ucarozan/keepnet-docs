#### Unplanned Fixes & Emergency Maintenance

While our regular maintenance operations are performed strictly within the scheduled windows listed above, the security and continuity of your service are our top priority.

For this reason, critical bug fixes or emergency interventions may occasionally be carried out outside these planned hours, but only under the following strict conditions:

* 🔐 Security Risk: The issue poses a direct security threat or exposure risk.
* ⚠️ Service Continuity: The issue prevents normal platform operation for customers.
* ⏱️ SLA Impact: The issue could lead to breach of availability, performance, or compliance standards if not addressed immediately.
* 🛠️ Minimal Disruption: All emergency fixes are designed to be applied with minimal to zero customer impact.

We understand the importance of stability and predictability for all our partners and customers. Therefore, no routine development, feature work, or non-urgent improvements are performed outside scheduled maintenance windows.

Only issues classified as _critical_ by our engineering and security teams are handled promptly to maintain the reliability and safety of the platform.

If an emergency maintenance window is required, affected customers may receive a brief notification depending on the severity and urgency.

Your trust and peace of mind remain at the core of our operations.
