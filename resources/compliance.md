## Data in Transit

Keepnet leverages Cloudflare's advanced security services to protect data in transit. This includes full SSL encryption with TLS 1.2, which encrypts all data before it travels across the internet, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure from interception. Additional layers of security are provided by Cloudflare’s suite of features, including:

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** This firewall guards against common web exploits and vulnerabilities, ensuring that malicious traffic is blocked before reaching Keepnet's infrastructure.
* **Bot Protection:** This feature distinguishes between legitimate users and malicious bots, blocking harmful traffic while allowing genuine user access.
* **Javascript Challenge:** By issuing challenges that require the execution of Javascript, Keepnet can prevent automated attacks and ensure that only browsers capable of executing Javascript can access the site.
* **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** This involves monitoring and controlling data transfers to prevent unauthorized data exfiltration.
* **DOS/DDOS Protection:** Cloudflare mitigates denial-of-service attacks, preserving availability and performance even under attack.
* **Captcha Features:** Captchas help distinguish human users from bots, adding an additional layer of security against automated attack tools.
* **DNSSEC Protection:** Keepnet has DNSSEC enabled for all domains, protecting users from DNS spoofing attacks by ensuring that DNS responses are authentic and have not been tampered with.

To further enhance security, Keepnet also implements the following protocols and controls:

* **HTTPS Protocols:** All traffic is served over HTTPS, which uses SSL/TLS encryption to create a secure channel over an insecure network.
* **Network Segmentation and Access Control:** This limits the reach of any potential intruder within the network and ensures that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data.
* **Regular Security Audits and Compliance Checks:** Keepnet conducts regular audits to ensure that all security measures are effective and compliant with current standards and best practices.
* **Advanced Threat Intelligence:** Keepnet uses threat intelligence feeds to proactively identify and respond to new threats as they emerge, enhancing its adaptive security stance.

By integrating these advanced tools and rigorous policies, Keepnet ensures that all data in transit is well-protected against a wide range of digital threats, maintaining client data’s confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## **Data at Rest Encryption Flow**&#x20;

We use  persisting encrypting/decrypting data.&#x20;

Data is encrypted/decrypted and persisted as encrypted on the database with Data Encryption Key. Without this key, the data can’t be visible as plain text.&#x20;

![Data Encryption Flow](<../.gitbook/assets/Data Encryption.png>)

The Data Encryption Key is sent to the database by the Application to encrypt/decrypt data.

The encryption method is symmetric encryption with the AES-256 algorithm.&#x20;

The Data Encryption Key is a cryptography random string with a certain length salted with another random cryptographically string.

The data, like credentials, email addresses, and company names, are encrypted.

For more information about  encryption options, please check [this official guide](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/encryption-options.html).

## Data at Rest Encryption for Files

Keepnet has developed a new feature that automatically encrypts all files sent or uploaded to their platform using AES encryption. This feature provides enhanced security and ensures that all data stored on the platform is protected against unauthorized access, theft, and other security threats. Users do not need to take any additional action to protect their files, as the encryption process is automatic.

AES encryption is a widely used encryption algorithm that is considered to be highly secure and is widely used by governments, financial institutions, and other organizations that need to protect sensitive data. Keepnet's encryption feature uses AES encryption with a randomly generated key to encrypt files, which are stored on its servers. The files can only be accessed by authorized services with the correct decryption key. By using Keepnet's encryption feature, users can rest assured that their files are protected against security threats without needing to worry about any additional steps or features.

## Policies

### Password Policy

We prioritize the security of our users' data. As part of our commitment to maintaining the highest security standards, we have implemented a robust password policy on our platform. This policy is designed to ensure that all user accounts remain secure from unauthorized access.

#### Password Complexity

We require all passwords to meet the following complexity requirements:

* **Length:** Passwords must be at least 8 characters long.
* **Character Types:** Passwords must include at least 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 number, and 1 special character (e.g., !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, \*).
* **No Personal Information:** Passwords should not contain any personal information such as your name, username, or date of birth.

#### Password Expiration

We understand that frequent password changes can sometimes lead to less secure behaviors, such as users choosing simpler passwords or reusing old ones. Therefore, we do not enforce a mandatory password expiration period. However, we strongly recommend that you change your password periodically and whenever you suspect that your account may have been compromised.&#x20;

Remember, choosing a unique and complex password and updating it regularly is one of the most effective ways to secure your account.

#### Account Lockout Policy

We prioritize user convenience while maintaining high-security standards. We understand that users may occasionally enter their passwords incorrectly. Therefore, we do not implement an account lockout policy after a certain number of unsuccessful login attempts.

#### Password Storage

We store passwords in a secure manner using modern cryptographic methods. All passwords are hashed and salted, ensuring that even in the unlikely event of a data breach, your password cannot be deciphered.

For more information, please click [here](compliance.md#next-generation-ui-data-encryption-flow).

#### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

We take the security of your account very seriously. To provide an additional layer of protection, we have implemented mandatory two-factor authentication (2FA) using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all accounts.&#x20;

When you log in, you'll be asked to enter a code from your MFA application in addition to your password. This ensures that even if someone else knows your password, they won't be able to access your account without the MFA code.

In the event that you can't access your MFA application, we provide an alternative method of authentication via SMS. You can receive a unique code on your registered mobile number, which you can use to access the platform.

Remember, keeping your MFA application and registered mobile number secure is crucial for the safety of your account.

#### Password Recovery

In case you forget your password, you can reset it using the "Forgot Password" option on the login page. An email will be sent to your registered email address with instructions on how to reset your password.

#### Summary

We encourage all users to follow these guidelines to ensure the security of their accounts. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please contact our support team.

Please note that this is a general password policy and may need to be adjusted based on your specific security requirements and standards.

#### Information Security Policy for Cloud Services

In accordance with the [Information Security Policy](https://doc.keepnetlabs.com/compliance#information-security-policy), Keepnet Labs LTD has established minimum standards of security relating to its use of Cloud services.

Keepnet Labs LTD considers the Cloud services it uses to be extensions of its own infrastructure that require an equal or increased degree of information security, depending on the nature of the service and of the assets stored or processed within it.

Keepnet Labs LTD requires that the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of assets within Cloud services are protected and preserved to at least the same level as assets within its own systems. Cloud services used by Keepnet Labs LTD are within the scope of Keepnet Labs LTD's information security management system (ISMS) and are subject to risk assessment and application of suitable technical and organizational controls in line with the procedures defined in the ISMS.

In particular, the controls applied to Cloud services within Keepnet Labs LTD's ISMS take into account:

* The information stored in the Cloud service and the risk of potential access and/or management by the Cloud service provider;
* The assets that are maintained in the Cloud service;
* The processes and programs used within the Cloud service;
* The users of the Cloud service;
* The administrators of the Cloud service and others with privileged access;
* The appropriate roles and responsibilities in respect of information and security and privacy management; and
* The geographic locations and countries where the Cloud service may store or process data, regardless of the duration of that storage or processing.

Keepnet Labs LTD requires the Cloud services it uses to adhere to all applicable legislative, regulatory, and contractual obligations, including those related to the protection of personally identifiable information (PII) and the rights of PII principals. These include, at a minimum, the obligations incumbent upon Keepnet Labs LTD, as identified in the List of Legislative and Regulatory References.

### ISMS Scope

For the purpose of operating an effective ISMS, the context of the organization is bifurcated into internal and external related parties. It is important to understand the unique context of an organization before starting the planning and scoping of ISMS to ensure the implemented ISMS gives the best return on investment.

To establish the business context for ISMS, we have identified and documented internal and external contexts that the organization must consider when they manage information security risks.

### **HR Policy**

Information systems face threats from many sources, including the actions of people -employees and contractor personnel. The intentional and unintentional actions of these individuals can potentially harm or disrupt information systems and their facilities. These actions can result in the destruction or modification of the data being processed, denial of service to the en&#x64;**-**&#x75;sers, and unauthorized disclosure of data, potentially jeopardizing our interests.

#### Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all employees and contractors are qualified for and understand their roles and responsibilities of their job duties and that access is removed once employment is terminated.

Database authentication credentials are a necessary part of authorizing an application to connect to internal databases. However, incorrect use, storage, and transmission of such credentials could lead to the compromise of very sensitive assets and be a springboard to wider compromise within the organization. &#x20;

This policy states the requirements for securely storing and retrieving database credentials for use by a program that will access a database running on our networks. Software applications running on our networks may require access to one of the many internal database servers. In order to access these databases, a program must authenticate to the database by presenting acceptable credentials. If the credentials are improperly stored, the credentials may be compromised, leading to a compromise of the database.

### Data Protection Policy&#x20;

We are committed to compliance with all relevant EU and Member State laws in respect of personal data and the protection of the “rights and freedoms” of individuals whose information we collect and process in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). To do this, we comply with the Data Protection Principles which are set out in this policy. &#x20;

The purpose of this policy is to set out our obligations and to demonstrate its commitment to compliance with it. The policy aims to fulfil the data protection requirements for personal data, which we collect and process in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

### Cryptography Policy&#x20;

The purpose of this Policy is to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information by applying appropriate levels of cryptographic controls.&#x20;

**As part of our Cryptography Policy, we keep all data encrypted in our database.**&#x20;

The scope of this policy applies to information system resources, including but not limited to data networks, servers, personal computers, mobile devices located at our, and not our locations, where these resources are under the jurisdiction and/or ownership of ours. Third parties with access to high or critical data owned by us shall also adhere to this policy.

### Configuration Management Policy

Configuration management manages the configuration of all hardware and software elements of information systems and networks and the security implications when changes occur. The initial configuration of the system or network must be documented in detail, and all subsequent changes to any components must be controlled through a complete and robust configuration management process. This policy complements business continuity management and disaster recovery by ensuring that documentation is available in the event that systems should need to be rebuilt. This policy will help reduce troubleshooting time by ensuring that appropriate personnel are notified when changes are made to any system.

### Clean Desk Policy

A clean desk policy can be an important tool to ensure that all confidential/restricted materials are removed from an end-user workspace and locked away when the items are not in use or an employee/contractor leaves his/her workstation. It is one of the top strategies to utilize when trying to reduce the risk of security breaches in the workplace. Such a policy can also increase employee’s/contractor's awareness about protecting sensitive information. &#x20;

The purpose of this policy is to establish the minimum requirements for maintaining a clean desk – where sensitive/critical information about our employees/contractors, our intellectual property, our customers and our vendors is secure in locked areas and out of site. A Clean Desk policy is not only ISO 27001 compliant, but it is also part of standard basic privacy controls.

### Change Management Policy&#x20;

We recognise that changes (the addition, modification, or removal of anything) to the organisation, business processes, information processing facilities, and systems that affect information security needs to be effectively managed and is extremely important in ensuring the quality delivery of our services.  We are aware that ineffective and uncontrolled change management could potentially result in significant system disruption, data corruption or loss. We have, therefore, formulated this Change Management Policy / Process in order to address the opportunities and associated risks. We will continue to formally manage changes to its Information Technology (“IT”) / business resources to prevent disruptions to the stability, confidentiality, integrity and availability of our IT systems, business processes and data.

### Business Continuity Planning

Business Continuity Management is in place to counteract interruptions to business activities and to protect critical business processes from the effects of major failures or disasters.

This business continuity strategy provides a framework that is consistent with corporate governance best practice.  It is closely linked to risk management and information security (the company is aligned to ISO27001), the disciplines complementing each other.  Business continuity plans provide structured guidance and procedures to help the company protect the welfare and deliver a minimum level of service in its critical functions following a disruptive incident.  They also help the company to recover in an organised manner.  An effective response will rely on a coordinated approach across different parts of the company, therefore provides a focal point for the validation and review of the Company’s business continuity activities.

It is the policy of the company to take all reasonable steps to ensure that in the event of a service interruption, the organisation will be able to maintain essential services and restore normal services as soon as possible in the circumstances prevailing at the time. The Business Continuity Management (BCM) Policy aims to introduce the concept of BCM to the company.&#x20;
