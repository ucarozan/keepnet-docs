# List customers with expired licenses

As a Reseller you list or export companies whose license renewal date is in the past (expired licenses) for compliance, renewal campaigns, or billing cleanup. Use a credential with Client Role = **Reseller**. Call company search with a **`filter`** on renewal date (e.g. renewal date before today) if the API supports it; otherwise export the full list and filter by the renewal date column client-side. Request body: see Endpoints → **Company** for filter structure and supported fields.

## POST /api/companies/search

Returns a paginated list of companies. Use **`filter`** to restrict results to companies whose **renewal date** is before today (expired). If the API supports a renewal-date filter, set it accordingly; otherwise use **`orderBy: "RenewalDate"`** and **`ascending: true`** and paginate or export, then filter client-side to keep only renewal date &lt; today.

> Retrieves a list of all companies. Use filter on renewal date to list only customers with expired licenses (renewal date in the past).

## POST /api/companies/search/export

Exports the company list to CSV or Excel. Apply the same filter as in search so the file contains only expired-license customers, or export all and filter by renewal date in your spreadsheet.
