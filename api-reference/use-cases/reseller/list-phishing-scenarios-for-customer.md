# List phishing scenarios for a customer

As a Reseller you can list a customer's phishing scenarios (templates used to run campaigns) scoped to that company. Get the customer's Company ID, then call the phishing-scenario search endpoint with **`X-KEEPNET-Company-Id`**. Use a credential with Client Role = **Reseller**. Use the scenario `resourceId` when creating or managing phishing campaigns for that customer.

***

## POST /api/companies/search

Get the customer's Company ID. Use the `resourceId` of the desired company in the next steps.

> Retrieves a paginated list of all companies you manage with license details. Each item includes `resourceId` — use it as the Company ID for scoped requests. **Test it:** Authorize with Client ID/Secret, then Send — request body is pre-filled.

{% openapi src="../../../.gitbook/assets/keepnet-api-spec.json" path="/api/companies/search" method="post" expanded="true" %}
[keepnet-api-spec.json](../../../.gitbook/assets/keepnet-api-spec.json)
{% endopenapi %}

From the response, pick the company and note its `resourceId`. Example: `"resourceId": "xC5kfGz7w2Nz"` → use as `X-KEEPNET-Company-Id` in the scenario requests below.

***

## POST /api/phishing-simulator/phishing-scenario/search

Returns a paginated list of phishing scenarios for that customer. Send **`X-KEEPNET-Company-Id`**. Response includes scenario `resourceId`, name, and other fields — use a scenario ID when creating a phishing campaign.

> Returns a list of the phishing scenarios. As a Reseller, send **`X-KEEPNET-Company-Id: <companyResourceId>`**. Request body: optional `filter`, `pageNumber`, `pageSize`, `orderBy`, `ascending`. **Test it:** Endpoints → **PhishingScenario** — use dummy data (H8d) and set the header to a Company ID from companies/search.

{% openapi src="../../../.gitbook/assets/keepnet-api-spec.json" path="/api/phishing-simulator/phishing-scenario/search" method="post" expanded="true" %}
[keepnet-api-spec.json](../../../.gitbook/assets/keepnet-api-spec.json)
{% endopenapi %}

To export the scenario list: **POST /api/phishing-simulator/phishing-scenario/search/export** — same header and body shape; see Endpoints → **PhishingScenario**.

## Common errors
