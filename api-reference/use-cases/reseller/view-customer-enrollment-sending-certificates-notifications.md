# View customer's enrollment sending, certificates, and notifications

As a Reseller you can view a customer's training enrollment **sending report** (emails sent, delivery status), **certificates**, **reminder mails**, and **notification activity logs** for a specific enrollment. Get the customer's Company ID and the enrollment ID from the enrollment list, then call the training-report and enrollment endpoints with **`X-KEEPNET-Company-Id`** so results are scoped to that customer. Use a credential with Client Role = **Reseller**.

***

## POST /api/companies/search

Get the customer's Company ID. Use the `resourceId` of the desired company in the next steps.

> Retrieves a paginated list of all companies you manage with license details. Each item includes `resourceId` — use it as the Company ID for scoped requests. **Test it:** Authorize with Client ID/Secret, then Send — request body is pre-filled.

{% openapi src="../../../.gitbook/assets/keepnet-api-spec.json" path="/api/companies/search" method="post" expanded="true" %}
[keepnet-api-spec.json](../../../.gitbook/assets/keepnet-api-spec.json)
{% endopenapi %}

From the response, pick the company and note its `resourceId`. Example: `"resourceId": "xC5kfGz7w2Nz"` → use as `X-KEEPNET-Company-Id` in all following requests.

***

## POST /api/enrollments/search

Get the customer's enrollment list so you can choose an enrollment to inspect. Send **`X-KEEPNET-Company-Id`**. From the response, take the `resourceId` of the enrollment you want (e.g. `"resourceId": "eNrl9Ab3k2Qp"`) — that is the `enrollmentId` for the sending, certificates, reminder, and notification endpoints below.

> Returns a list of enrollments. As a Reseller, send **`X-KEEPNET-Company-Id: <companyResourceId>`**. Request body: `filter` (required — use the structure with `Condition`, `SearchInputTextValue`, `FilterGroups`; see [View customer's enrollment list and report](view-customer-enrollment-list-and-report.md) for a full example), optional `pageNumber`, `pageSize`, `orderBy`, `ascending`, `enrollmentType`.

## Common errors

* **403 Forbidden** — Credential is not Reseller, or the Company ID is not one you manage. Set Client Role = **Reseller**. [Roles and permissions →](../../../next-generation-product/platform/company/system-users/user-roles.md)
* **401 Unauthorized** — Missing or invalid token. Request a new token via `POST /connect/token`.
