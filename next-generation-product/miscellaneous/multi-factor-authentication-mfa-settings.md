# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Settings

This article covers how system users can enable Multi-Factor Authentication to log in to the platform more securely.

## What is Multi-Factor Authentication

Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) is an authentication method that requires the user to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to the platform. Even if the user account has been compromised, logins performed without validating the Multi-Factor Authentication code will be rejected, and the account would be inaccessible.

## Supported Authentication Applications for MFA

When logging onto the platform, Multi-Factor Authentication is required. The system user must configure MFA within 15 days of the user account being created. It is possible to log in without utilizing MFA at that date range.
