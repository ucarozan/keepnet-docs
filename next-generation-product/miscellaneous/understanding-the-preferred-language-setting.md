# Understanding the Preferred Language Setting

The Keepnet platform allows organizations to configure language preferences at different levels:

## Company’s Preferred Language (Mandatory, Default: English)

* The primary language used for phishing campaigns, training, and system notification emails.
* This field cannot be empty; the default is English.
* The system admin can prioritize listing in this language for phishing templates, scenarios, landing pages, and security training.

## User’s Preferred Language (Optional, for Hyper-Personalization)

* If enabled by the system admin, phishing campaigns and training enrollments will prioritize the user’s preferred language.
* If no preferred language is set or content is unavailable, the platform defaults to the Company’s Preferred Language.

## Example Use Cases for Company’s Preferred Language

### Phishing Simulations

* The platform prioritizes the Company’s Preferred Language unless configured differently.
* **How It Works:**
  * Phishing scenarios, email templates, and landing pages are displayed first in the Company’s Preferred Language.
  * If content is available in multiple languages, the default listing prioritizes the Company’s Preferred Language.
  * Admins can manually override the language selection if needed.
* **Example:**
  * **Company’s Preferred Language:** Spanish
  * **Available Email Templates:** Spanish, English
  * The system defaults to Spanish, with other languages available for selection.

### Security Awareness Training Library

* Training materials like learning paths, posters, and screensavers are prioritized in the Company’s Preferred Language unless configured otherwise.
* **How It Works:**
  * The platform displays training materials in the Company’s Preferred Language.
  * Admins can manually search, filter, and select other languages.
  * Admins can override language selection if needed.
* **Example:**
  * **Company’s Preferred Language:** English
  * **Available Training Modules:** English, Spanish, French
  * The system lists English training first, with manual switching available.

### Sending a Phishing Campaign Based on User’s Preferred Language

When launching a phishing campaign, Keepnet automatically assigns training content based on the following rules:

* If hyper-personalization is **not** enabled, the campaign content is assigned in its original language.
* If hyper-personalization is enabled:
  * The system checks if the User’s Preferred Language is set.
  * If phishing content is available in this language, it is assigned accordingly.
  * If unavailable, the system defaults to the Company’s Preferred Language.
  * If neither is available, the default system language (English) is used.
* **Example:**
  * **Company’s Preferred Language:** Italian
  * **User’s Preferred Language:** Dutch
  * **Phishing Scenarios In:** Italian, French, English
  * Since Dutch phishing content is unavailable, the system assigns Italian.

### Enrolling Training Based on User’s Preferred Language

When enrolling users in training, Keepnet prioritizes the best-matching language based on the following rules:

* If hyper-personalization is **not** enabled, training is assigned in its original language.
* If hyper-personalization is enabled:
  * The platform checks if the User’s Preferred Language is set.
  * If training is available in this language, it is assigned accordingly.
  * If unavailable, the Company’s Preferred Language is used.
  * If neither is available, the default system language is applied.
* **Example:**
  * **Company’s Preferred Language:** English
  * **User’s Preferred Language:** Russian
  * **Training Available In:** English, French
  * Since Russian training is unavailable, the system assigns English.

### How the Platform Handles Language Preferences – Priority Order

The Keepnet platform applies the following priority when assigning phishing campaign training and security awareness enrollments:

1. If hyper-personalization is **not** enabled:
   1. The system assigns the content language as selected by the system admin.
2. If hyper-personalization **is** enabled:
   1. **User’s Preferred Language** (if available)
   2. **Company’s Preferred Language** (if User’s Preferred Language is unavailable)
   3. **Default System Language** (English) (if neither is available)
