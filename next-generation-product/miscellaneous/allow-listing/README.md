## FAQ

### Q: Can I use Phishing Simulation on Office 365 without using Allow Listing?

A: Yes, you can. Our Direct Email Creation (DEC) feature enables you to send simulated phishing emails directly to users' inboxes, eliminating the need for Allow Listing. Discover how to leverage the DEC feature [here](../../platform/company/company-settings/direct-email-creation/).

### Q: Does Allow Listing create a security weakness?

A: Allowing IP addresses or PTR Domains are owned by the platform, and only authorized admins are able to send emails to selected target users. Therefore, it does not create a security weakness for the organization.

### Q: Can I run training assignments or phishing tests without allow listing?

A: Yes, you can, but it is definitely not recommended. If allow listing is not properly done, there may be delivery difficulties. The best practice is to allow the platform IPs or PTR Domains before using the product.
