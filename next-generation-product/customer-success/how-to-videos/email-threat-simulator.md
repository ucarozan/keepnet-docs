# Email Threat Simulator

Our Email Threat Simulator is an easy way to see how many real threats are currently able to bypass your email security. Quickly review which ones aren't blocked and take action to block these in the future. Each time there is a new threat vector, we will add this to Email Threat Simulator so you can consistently stay informed about which active threats can bypass your current SEGs.&#x20;
