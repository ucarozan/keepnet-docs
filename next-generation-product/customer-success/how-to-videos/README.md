# 📽️ How-to Videos

Our collection of short, step-by-step video guides is designed to help you get the most out of Keepnet’s security awareness tools. From setting up and running phishing simulations, to delivering engaging training, through to deploying the Phishing Reporter button, each video provides clear, practical guidance to make every stage simple and effective.

You’ll learn how to send phishing campaigns, customise templates, deliver training in multiple languages, understand how employees receive and access their courses, track results through reporting, and even automate training for new users or groups. We’ll also guide you through customising and deploying the Phishing Reporter button—whether for testing or rolling it out across your entire organisation.

With these tutorials, you’ll have everything you need to launch, manage, and measure your awareness programmes with confidence.
