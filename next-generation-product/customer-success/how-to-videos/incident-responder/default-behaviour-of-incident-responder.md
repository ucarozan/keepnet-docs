# Default Behaviour of Incident Responder

### **🤖 Analysis**

1. An employee reports a suspicious email using the _Keepnet Reporter Button_ or _Native Microsoft Report button_
2. Keepnet analysis the reported email for malicious content in seconds using 5+ integrations simultaneously
3. Keepnet automatically shares the analysis result with the employee via email&#x20;

### **🔎 Investigate**

1. When analysis result is “Malicious”, Keepnet starts an automatic investigation to find all instances of the malicious content
2. Once investigation is complete, Keepnet System Admins receive Investigation Report
3. Keepnet System Admin can then log into Keepnet and delete all instances of malicious emails in a few clicks
