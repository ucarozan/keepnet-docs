# Example Year 1 Campaign

To help you hit the ground running, our Customer Success team has hand-picked the most popular and effective phishing campaigns for your first year. These examples give you tried-and-tested inspiration to build an engaging programme that develops employee awareness from day one. We’ve also created separate campaign tracks for Google and Microsoft, so you can focus on the tools your employees use most and strengthen their ability to spot phishing attempts where it matters.

Each example campaign is tailored to a specific package. To find the campaign strategy relevant to your organisation, please use the navigation menu on the left:

* **xHRM** – Full package including Incident Responder
* **SBCP 360** – All simulation modules: phishing, quishing, callback, smishing, and vishing
* **SBCP Plus** – Email-based simulations: phishing, quishing, and callback
* **SBCP Essentials** – Phishing only

Select your package to view curated campaign examples designed to help employees recognise, respond to, and report the types of threats included in your plan
