# Campaign Strategy

This section explains how to structure phishing awareness campaigns using Keepnet. It introduces three approaches — **Randomised, Targeted, and The Blend** — showing how each helps you:

* Deliver relevant scenarios to employees
* Scale campaigns efficiently
* Collect meaningful data on how employees respond to phishing threats

To help you hit the ground running, our Customer Success team has **hand-picked the most popular and effective phishing campaigns** for your first year. These examples give you tried-and-tested inspiration to build an engaging programme that develops employee awareness from day one.

We’ve also created **separate campaign tracks for Google and Microsoft**, so you can focus on the tools your employees use most and strengthen their ability to spot phishing attempts where it matters.

You can explore each approach in detail using the links below, including step-by-step guidance and tutorial videos for setting up campaigns:

| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Randomised | Unique, randomly selected scenarios    | Capture realistic employee responses while preventing alerting        |
| Targeted   | Specific scenarios selected for impact | Focus on high-risk areas and key threats                              |
| The Blend  | Combination of both approaches         | Broad awareness plus targeted focus on critical users and departments |
