This section explains how to structure phishing awareness campaigns using Keepnet. It introduces three approaches â€” **Randomised, Targeted, and The Blend** â€” showing how each helps you:

* Deliver relevant scenarios to employees
* Scale campaigns efficiently
* Collect meaningful data on how employees respond to phishing threats

To help you hit the ground running, our Customer Success team has **hand-picked the most popular and effective phishing campaigns**. These examples give you tried-and-tested inspiration to build an engaging programme that develops employee awareness from day one.
