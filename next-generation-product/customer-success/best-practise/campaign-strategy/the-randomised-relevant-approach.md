# The Randomised, Relevant Approach

The Randomised Approach is ideal for organisations looking to **raise awareness broadly while collecting meaningful data** on employee responses. Each employee receives a **unique, randomly selected scenario** from categories youâ€™ve chosen, keeping campaigns relevant to their role or department.

You can automate campaigns to run **weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or quarterly**, keeping your approach scalable without additional manual work. This ensures you consistently gather data on how employees respond to phishing threats, **without the risk of employees alerting each other**.
