# The Blend

The Blend Approach combines the strengths of both the Randomised and Targeted methods, giving organisations a **balanced, scalable, and highly effective phishing awareness programme**.

With this approach, you run:

1. **Monthly randomised campaigns**
   * All employees receive unique, randomly selected scenarios from categories you choose.
   * Keeps awareness broad and realistic while preventing employees from alerting each other.
2. **Quarterly targeted campaigns**
   * Focus on high-risk users, departments that need extra awareness, or key functions such as **HR, Finance, and IT**.
   * Ensure everyone in these groups experiences and sees examples of the most relevant phishing threats for their role.

**Key benefits:**

* **Comprehensive coverage:** Combines broad awareness with focused attention on high-risk areas.
* **Scalable:** Automate randomised campaigns while scheduling targeted campaigns at key intervals.
* **Industry-relevant exposure:** Employees see the most common phishing threats in your industry — for example, DocuSign, Microsoft notifications, or reset password scams — reinforcing recognition and response skills.
* **Actionable insights:** Collect detailed data on both general employee behaviour and responses from high-risk groups to prioritise further training and interventions.
