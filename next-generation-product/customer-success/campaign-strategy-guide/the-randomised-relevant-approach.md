# The Randomised, Relevant Approach

The Randomised Approach is ideal for organisations looking to raise awareness broadly while collecting meaningful data on employee responses. Each employee receives a unique, randomly selected scenario from categories youâ€™ve chosen, keeping campaigns relevant to their role or department.

You can automate campaigns to run **weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or quarterly**, keeping your approach scalable without additional manual work. This ensures you consistently gather data on how employees respond to phishing threats, **without the risk of employees alerting each other**.

**Key benefits:**

* **Broad awareness:** Employees receive different scenarios from selected categories, making training realistic and engaging.
* **Scalable:** Automate campaigns across the organisation without extra administrative effort.
* **Data-driven:** Collect consistent insights into employee behaviour to inform future campaigns.
