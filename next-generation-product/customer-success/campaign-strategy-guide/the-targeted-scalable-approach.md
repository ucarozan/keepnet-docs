# The Targeted, Scalable Approach

The Targeted Approach is ideal for organisations that want to **focus on specific threats or high-risk areas**. With this method, you choose exactly which scenarios to send, giving you complete control over your campaign content and timing.

You can run campaigns in one of two ways:

1. **Distribute scenarios across your target group**
   * Distribute several specific scenarios to employees at the same time.
   * Ensures variety while keeping campaigns focused on key threats.
2. **Pre-schedule a campaign for the year**
   * Select all scenarios you want to use in advance.
   * Run them monthly (e.g., scenario 1 in month 1, scenario 2 in month 2, etc.).
   * Saves time by automating the campaign while ensuring full coverage of targeted threats.

**Key benefits:**

* **Focused impact:** Target high-risk employees or departments with scenarios that matter most.
* **Industry-relevant exposure:** Ensure every employee has experienced and seen examples of the most common phishing threats in your industry — for example, DocuSign, Microsoft notifications, or reset password scams — so your team recognises these threats in real life while you collect valuable response data.
* **Actionable insights:** Collect data on responses to specific threats, helping to prioritise training and awareness efforts.
