# ðŸŒŽ Multi-Language Features

Keepnet makes it simple to deliver security awareness programs that feel authentic and accessible to every employee, anywhere in the world. Our multi-language features ensure your training and phishing simulations are effective across regions, cultures, and languages -without added complexity.

* [**Multi-language Training**](multi-language-training.md) â€“ Set up enrolments so employees can choose their preferred language directly from the training email, ensuring inclusivity and higher engagement.
* [**Localisation**](localisation.md) â€“ Instantly adapt any phishing template into multiple languages, with AI adjusting tone, dates, currencies, and formatting for cultural accuracy. Multiple localisations can be completed at once for faster, more realistic campaigns.
* [**Hyper Personalisation**](hyper-personalisation.md) â€“ Launch one campaign and automatically deliver it to each employee in their local language, creating tailored, authentic simulations at scale.

Together, these features give you the flexibility to run global programmes that resonate locallyâ€”helping you strengthen security awareness across your entire workforce.
