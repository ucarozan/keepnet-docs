# Localisation

Customers can take any of our 16,000+ phishing templates - or your own custom scenarios -and localise them into any language of your choice. Keepnet doesnâ€™t just translate; it adapts the entire email, including subject lines, body text, currencies, dates, and tone, to feel natural and authentic for the target region. Multiple localisations can be completed at once, making it simple to launch truly global campaigns in minutes.

With optional human review for added quality assurance and unified reporting across all languages, you can scale phishing simulations faster, more cost-effectively, and with greater realism than ever before.
