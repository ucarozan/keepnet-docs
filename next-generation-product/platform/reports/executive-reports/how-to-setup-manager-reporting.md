# How to Setup Manager Reporting

**Manager Reporting** lets you **automatically email managers** a scheduled report that shows **their team’s Phishing Simulation** and/or **Security Awareness Training** statistics. This helps managers track progress, follow up with their team, and supports a stronger security culture with less manual work for system admins.

## Prerequisite: Add Manager Information to Target Users

Before scheduling manager reports, ensure each target user has a manager assigned.

* Go to **Company > Target Users**
* **Create** or **Edit** a target user
* Fill the required manager fields:
  * **Manager First Name** _(Required)_
  * **Manager Last Name** _(Required)_
  * **Manager Email** _(Required)_

### Optional: Sync manager info via SCIM (Entra ID)

If you want to sync Manager data (first name, last name, email address) automatically for your target users, follow this guide:\

### Step 1: Create an Executive Report with Manager Metrics

You create an Executive Report first, then schedule it.

* Go to **Reports > Executive Reports**
* Click **+ NEW**
* Expand **Manager Metrics**
* Choose **one** of the following _(one manager metric per executive report)_:
  * **Phishing Activity** (for simulation statistics)
  * **Training Activity** (for training statistics)
* Customize the report:
  * **Executive Report Name**
  * **Date Range**
  * **Date Created**, **Company Name**
* Click **Save Report.**

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you want both **Phishing Activity** and **Training Activity** manager reporting, create **two separate Executive Reports** (one per metric).
{% endhint %}

## Step 2: Schedule the Report to Send to Managers

After the Executive Report is saved, schedule it for delivery.

* Go to **Reports > Scheduled Reports**
* Click **+ NEW**
* Fill the schedule settings:
  * **Schedule Name**
  * **Frequency** (One Time, Weekly, Every two weeks, Monthly, Quarterly)
  * **Report Type:** Executive Report
  * **Report:** Select your **Manager Executive Report**
  * **Schedule Time** and **Timezone**
  * (Optional) Enable **Region-Aware Time Zone Delivery**
* In **Send to Manager**:
  * Select the managers who will receive the report
* Click **Save.**

After saving:

* Managers receive the first email shortly after (then continue based on the selected frequency).
* Each manager’s report reflects **their team members**, based on the **Manager fields** you set under **Target Users**.

## FAQs
