### 3.1 Overall Performance

**Card title:** _Overall Performance – Track your performance, points, and rank for the last 30 days._

* **Performance (%)**
  * **What it is:** A single score for the last 30 days (e.g. `41%`).

* **Points**
  * **What it is:** Total points the user has earned.
  * **What it means:** The user's current total points from the leaderboard activities. [The user can earn more ](gamification-report.md)if the user doesn't open or fail to complete simulations, complete the training and such other actions.
* **Rank**
  * **What it is:** The user’s position compared to others (1 = top performer).
  * **What it means:** Shows how this user compares to the other three employees with good performance at the same company.
* **See Ranking Details**
  * Opens the **Leaderboard** area to see where these numbers sit among all users.

### 3.2 Recent Badges

**Card title:** _Recent Badges – View your last 3 badges earned from your actions and behaviours._

Each badge tile shows:

* **Badge name & icon** – e.g., _Perfect Score_, _Zero Click Champion_.
* **Earned on \[date]** – the date the badge was awarded.

3. **Detection Accuracy (e.g. 0% success rate)**
   * Approximate logic: **Detection Accuracy ≈ reported simulations / total delivered simulations for this user.**

## FAQs

### **Q: Do employees need a new password?**

A: No. They either use SSO/SAML or a one-time email login link.

### **Q: Can employees see other people’s details?**

A: No. Each user only sees their own detailed data. Leaderboards show limited info for rankings only.

### **Q: What if the email doesn’t arrive?**

A: Ask them to check spam/junk and confirm they used their registered work email. If it still fails, contact Keepnet Support.
