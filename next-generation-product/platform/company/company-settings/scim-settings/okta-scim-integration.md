## How to Sync Okta User Groups Directly to the Keepnet Platform

If you have user groups defined in your Okta environment and wish to sync them — including the users in those groups — directly to the Keepnet platform, please follow the steps below.

#### Steps for Keepnet Platform

1. Log in to the **Keepnet platform.**
2. **Go to** `Company > Company Settings > SCIM Settings`.
3. **Click** `+ NEW`, **enter a name**, and then **click** `Next`.
4. On the **Group** **Settings** page, enable the **"Synchronize groups with Identity Management Platform"** option and click **Save**.
5. **Copy the SCIM token** to your notepad for later use.

#### Steps for Okta Platform

1. **Complete all steps in the** [**OKTA Configuration**](okta-scim-integration.md#okta-configuration) **section first**, then return to this section after successfully connecting Okta to Keepnet.
2. **After successful integration**, open your **Okta dashboard** and go to the **Push Groups** menu of your SCIM 2.0 application.
3. **Add the target groups** from your Okta directory to the **Push Groups** menu. This will initiate the synchronization process.
4. **Wait for synchronization** — typically within a few seconds to a few minutes, the groups and associated users will be synced to the Keepnet platform.
5. **Log in to the Keepnet platform** and navigate to:`Company > Target Users > Groups`
6. **Verify** that the Okta groups have been successfully synced. You should see both the groups and their respective users listed.
