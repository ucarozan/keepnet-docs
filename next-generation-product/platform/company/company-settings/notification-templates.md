## FAQs

### Q: Can I be notified when someone has been enrolled in training due to engaging in a simulation?

A: Yes! You can use the CC feature on the "Enrollment after Failed in a Simulation" template to CC in whichever email address you would like. Please note that if an email is in CC it cannot  also appear in To. Therefore, we recommend using an email that does not belong to any target user email.&#x20;

### **Q: Can I use the "{ENROLLMENT\_NAME}" merge tag in the Subject line of Training Enrollment, Learning Path Enrollment, Poster Enrollment, and Infographic Enrollment notification templates?**

A: Yes, you can use the "{ENROLLMENT\_NAME}" merge tag, but only for those specific notification templates.
