# White Labeling

White labeling is the rebranding of a product or service. Distributors and MSP partners can create a unique, customized corporate identity for the platform, including the company name, platform access URL, platform logos, notification template logos, footer links, and many other fields.

## How to White Labeling

After logging in to the platform, select **Company > Company Settings** from the left sidebar menu. Click the **White Labeling** tab. Here, you can select various customization options and save your choices by clicking the **Save Changes** button at the bottom of the window.

To return to the default settings at any time, click the **Reset to Default** button on the right at the bottom of the window.

### Available Fields for White Labeling

This feature is only available to customize for "Reseller" role system users. The system users who have the "Company Admin" role cannot customize this high-level customization.&#x20;

Please contact your Reseller if you are not able to customize white labeling.
