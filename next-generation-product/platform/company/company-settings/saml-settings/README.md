# SAML Settings

This document explains the functionality of the SAML feature as well as how to set up a SAML to log in to the platform without using email/password credentials.

## About SAML

The platform supports single sign-on (SSO) authentication, which enables administrative users to log in to applications quickly and securely in a single session, without the need to use additional passwords.

## How to Configure SAML

From the main menu, go to **Company > Company Settings > SAML Settings** and then click the **+ NEW** button to create a new SAML configuration.&#x20;

The details of the SAML configuration edit page are provided in the table below.

### Configuration Details

{% hint style="warning" %}
The privileges of the automatic account generated for admins who log in to the system using SSO can be defined in the Default Role field. The Custom Roles can be created to restrict the privileges, please see more [here](../../system-users/user-roles.md).

## FAQ

### Q: An admin can't login to platform over SAML and sees a "Your account not registered..." message.

A: The admin email address must be created in the platform under the Company > System Users page in order to log in to the platform over SAML authentication.

### Q: Does the platform still require MFA with SSO/SAML integration?

**A**: No, MFA is only required for email and password logins. With SSO/SAML, all authentication, including MFA, is managed by the SSO provider.
