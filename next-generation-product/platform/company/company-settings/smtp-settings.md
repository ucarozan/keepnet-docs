## What is SMTP used for?

The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is an internet standard communication protocol for email transmission. The platform includes a default email service available to all customers; however, you also have the option to use your own email server to send phishing, training and other emails.

If you have the [Phishing Simulator](https://keepnetlabs.com/products/phishing-simulator) product, enabling SMTP relay authorization on the mail server will allow you to mimic brand impersonation phishing techniques, including the sender's address information.

The steps below explain how to define proxy server settings for the platform to access the internet or other networks.
