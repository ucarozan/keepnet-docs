# Direct Email Creation

This page explains the benefits of the **Direct Email Creation (DEC)** feature and how to use it with [Google Workspace](direct-email-creation-for-google-workspace.md) or [Microsoft 365](direct-email-creation-for-microsoft-365.md). Direct Email Creation (DEC) is a feature that connects to your Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 to the platform. By using this feature, you can create phishing simulation emails directly in the user’s inbox instead of sending the emails over SMTP protocol.

## Benefits of Direct Email Creation

The customer’s security tools or sandboxes are sometimes hard to do whitelisting, whitelisting not works always, sometimes whitelisting is not possible, maintenance, or troubleshooting. The nature of these tools is to analyze links or attachments in the email and because of that, false positive reporting occurs during the phishing campaign launch.

This feature resolves any listed reason above by creating the simulation email directly in the user’s inbox by connecting the DEC feature with your Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace.
