## **Why Create Company Definitions?**

Unique definitions help resellers to provide the best service to multiple tenants sharing software. There is the opportunity to refine various elements according to the needs of each company and simplify management.

The platform provides the ability to view, add, edit, and delete customer companies and administer each as appropriate.

The authority to create and manage companies is only available to Resellers. Each customer will access the features of their company based on their license type.
