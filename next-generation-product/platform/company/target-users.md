# Target Users

The **Target Users** are those who receive e-mails that will be sent through the platform. This document explains how to add target users to the platform so that it can send training, phishing, campaigns, and other emails to them.

## Managing Target Users

You can manage all target users from the **Company > Target Users** menu. You may create, remove, modify, and add target users to a group on this page.

{% hint style="info" %}
The platform will notify the system user to validate the email domains after creating the target users on the platform. For more information, click [here](company-settings/allowed-domains.md).
{% endhint %}

## Methods for Adding Target Users

{% hint style="info" %}
The downloaded spreadsheet has time zones in SHEET2. Please copy all time zones from the "Time Zone" column in SHEET2 and paste them properly for your target user's time zone column.
{% endhint %}

After your file is ready, please follow the steps below:

* Go to the **Company > Target Users** menu.
* Click the **"New"** button.

### 2. Adding Target Users Manually

​​From the left menu, select **Company > Target Users**. Then, click **New** and click **"Add users manually"** on the new page. Fill out the required boxes in the **"Add New User"** window to add a new target user to the system.

<table data-full-width="false"><thead><tr><th width="164">Field</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>First name</td><td>Specify the first name information of the target user.</td></tr><tr><td>Last name</td><td>Specify the last name information of the target user.</td></tr><tr><td>Email</td><td>Specify the email information of the target user.</td></tr><tr><td>Phone Number</td><td>You may add target user's phone number.</td></tr><tr><td>Department</td><td>Specify the department information of the target user.</td></tr><tr><td>Time Zone</td><td>Select a time zone and send campaigns to the target user in their own time zone.</td></tr><tr><td>Target Groups</td><td>Add the new user to the target group(s).</td></tr><tr><td>Proritiy</td><td>Specify the priority information of the target user.

### 3. Adding Target Users via SCIM

SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) is a standard that automates the sharing of user identity information (e.g., first name, last name, email, phone number) across multiple identity platforms. Keepnet's platform supports SCIM integration to automate and synchronize target user data from identity providers to the platform.&#x20;

To use this option, please follow the steps below:

* Go to the **Company > Target Users** menu.
* Click the **"New"** button.
* Click the "**SCIM Sync"** option.

Please click [here](company-settings/scim-settings/) to learn how to set up or synchronize your employees' information via SCIM on the platform.&#x20;

### 4. Adding Target Users via Google Workspace

The Google Workspace User Sync feature allows you to automatically import and synchronize user information (e.g., first name, last name, email, phone number) from Google Workspace into Keepnet's platform. This ensures that your user data is always up to date without the need for manual updates.

To use this option, please follow the steps below:

* Go to the **Company > Target Users** menu.
* Click the **"New"** button.
* Select the **"Google Sync"** option.

Please click [here](company-settings/google-user-provisioning.md) to learn how to set up or synchronize your employees' information via Google Workspace on the platform.

### 5. Adding Target Users via LDAP

LDAP is a standard protocol that allows platforms to access an Active Directory to retrieve user information, such as name, surname, email, department, phone number, and other details, enabling automatic synchronization with the platform. The benefits of LDAP include automating user management, saving time, reducing stress, and minimizing manual user management tasks.

To use this option, please follow the steps below:

* Go to the **Company > Target Users** menu.
* Click the **"New"** button.
* Click the "**Import from LDAP"** option.

Please click [here](../../getting-started/2.-add-target-users/add-users-via-ldap.md) to learn how to set up and synchronize your employees' information via LDAP integration.
