# Target Users

The **Target Users** are those who receive e-mails that will be sent through the platform. This document explains how to add target users to the platform so that it can send training, phishing, campaigns, and other emails to them.

## Managing Target Users

You can manage all target users from the **Company > Target Users** menu. You may create, remove, modify, and add target users to a group on this page.

{% hint style="info" %}
The platform will notify the system user to validate the email domains after creating the target users on the platform. For more information, click [here](company-settings/allowed-domains.md).
{% endhint %}

## Methods for Adding Target Users

{% hint style="info" %}
The downloaded spreadsheet has time zones in SHEET2. Please copy all time zones from the "Time Zone" column in SHEET2 and paste them properly for your target user's time zone column.
{% endhint %}

After your file is ready, please follow the steps below:

* Go to the **Company > Target Users** menu.
* Click the **"New"** button.
* Click the "**Import from a file"** option.

### 3. Adding Target Users via SCIM

SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) is a standard that automates the sharing of user identity information (e.g., first name, last name, email, phone number) across multiple identity platforms. Keepnet's platform supports SCIM integration to automate and synchronize target user data from identity providers to the platform.&#x20;

To use this option, please follow the steps below:

* Go to the **Company > Target Users** menu.
* Click the **"New"** button.
* Click the "**SCIM Sync"** option.

Please click [here](company-settings/scim-settings/) to learn how to set up or synchronize your employees' information via SCIM on the platform.&#x20;

### 4. Adding Target Users via Google Workspace

The Google Workspace User Sync feature allows you to automatically import and synchronize user information (e.g., first name, last name, email, phone number) from Google Workspace into Keepnet's platform. This ensures that your user data is always up to date without the need for manual updates.

To use this option, please follow the steps below:

* Go to the **Company > Target Users** menu.
* Click the **"New"** button.
* Select the **"Google Sync"** option.

Please click [here](company-settings/google-user-provisioning.md) to learn how to set up or synchronize your employees' information via Google Workspace on the platform.

### 5. Adding Target Users via LDAP

LDAP is a standard protocol that allows platforms to access an Active Directory to retrieve user information, such as name, surname, email, department, phone number, and other details, enabling automatic synchronization with the platform.

To use this option, please follow the steps below:

* Go to the **Company > Target Users** menu.
* Click the **"New"** button.
* Click the "**Import from LDAP"** option.

Please click [here](../../getting-started/2.-add-target-users/add-users-via-ldap.md) to learn how to set up and synchronize your employees' information via LDAP integration.

New Hires is an automated target group designed to include new employees in your organization for a period of 90 days. This group ensures that new hires receive focused training and simulations, helping them quickly adapt to your organization's security culture.

The training and simulations for this group are selected and assigned by system admins. This ensures that the content is tailored to improve their awareness and preparedness against potential security threats. After the 90-day period, the new hires are automatically removed from the group.

## Non-Simulated Users

The **Non-Simulated Users** group is an automated target group designed to include users who have not yet participated in any phishing simulations. Users are automatically added to this group and remain in it until they engage in their first simulation. This allows organizations to focus on users who have not been exposed to phishing scenarios, helping them build security awareness from the ground up.

Simulations for this group can be specifically tailored to introduce users to phishing risks and improve their ability to recognize potential threats. Once a user completes a simulation, they are automatically removed from the group.

Users are automatically assigned to this group until they complete at least one training session. This allows organizations to prioritize security awareness training for employees who have yet to engage with learning modules.

Training content for this group can be tailored to provide essential cybersecurity knowledge, ensuring that users gain the skills needed to protect against evolving threats. Once a user enrolls in a training course, they are automatically removed from the group.

This helps track performance and engagement. For more details, visit [Gamification Report](../reports/gamification-report.md) documentation.

## Target Users Widgets

The **Company > Target Users** page includes four widgets that help you quickly understand the status of your user base and track user changes over time. Each widget displays a number and provides a clear summary of who is currently active, who is inactivated, who is deleted, and how many users were added during a selected month for billing purposes.

The widgets are:

* **Active Users:** Shows users who are currently active on the platform. These users can receive emails and can be tracked in simulations and reporting.
* **Inactive Users:** Shows users who are temporarily inactivated. The simulation or training delivery is paused for these users, but their existing data remains available in the platform.
* **Deleted Users:** Shows users removed from active use. These users are no longer part of the active user base, but their historical records are retained for reporting and audit purposes.
* **Monthly Users:** Shows how many users were added to the platform during the selected month, regardless of whether they are currently Active, Inactive, or Deleted. You can change the month using the selector. Monthly Users data is available starting from December for all customers.
