## Understanding Bot Activity vs. Human Activity in Reports

In quishing campaign reports, **Human Activity** refers to real actions taken by users, such as opening emails, clicking quishing links, or submitting data. In contrast, **Bot Activity** represents automated interactions triggered by email security systems, spam filters, or sandboxing tools. These bots scan emails and follow links as part of their protective duties—sometimes even before users see the message.

Bot activity may appear in both **Opened** and **Scanned** **QR Link** sections of the report. For example, if a security system opens an email to analyze it, or clicks a link to test the destination, these actions may be captured and flagged as bot interactions.

To ensure accurate reporting, the platform automatically detects and labels such activity based on predefined detection rules. Any record classified as **Bot Activity** will carry a special tag and can be excluded from the view by clicking the **“Hide Bot Activity”** button. Admins can also hover over the info (ⓘ) icon in the **Activity Type** column to see which rule was triggered.

The detection rules are:

* **A1 – Unusual User-Agent Interacted:** Triggered when an atypical or suspicious user-agent (browser identifier) is detected.
* **A2 – Honeypot Link Reused:** The hidden quishing link inside of the email clicked multiple times by the same IP and user-agent within 5 minutes—indicating automation.
* **A3 – Same-Second Activity Spike:** Multiple activities occurred at the exact same time, which is unlikely for human users.
* **A4 – Stop Bot Activity Challenge Failed:**
  * **A4.1** – The quishing phishing link was clicked, but the invisible browser javascript challenge was not passed.
  * **A4.2** – The browser failed to load required scripts that a real user’s browser would normally execute.

If customers see several entries marked as **Bot Activity**, it typically means that their security tools pre-screened the quishing simulation links. To evaluate real user behavior, they should filter the report by **Activity Type** or use the **“Hide Bot Activity”** toggle. For better accuracy in future simulations, they may consider whitelisting Keepnet domains to reduce interference from automated systems.

By filtering out bot noise, organizations gain a clearer understanding of **true user actions and risk levels**.
