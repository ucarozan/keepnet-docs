## What is Threat Intelligence?

The **Threat Intelligence** product scans the web, searching for signals and data that may represent a breach of your data security and a threat to your business. The constant vigilance afforded to you by the Threat Intelligence product shortens the time between the potential data breach and defensive response, reducing the opportunity for fraudulent activity.

In the Threat Intelligence product, you can check for data leaks for your previously allowed email domains in the **Domain** **Allowlist** menu.

Please find the documentation for the domain allowlist [here](company/company-settings/allowed-domains.md).
