# Microsoft Ribbon Phishing Reporter

The **Microsoft** **Ribbon** **Phishing** **Reporter** allows your users to easily report suspicious emails and help protect your organization from cyberattacks. When you integrate the Phishing Reporter with Microsoft's integrated spam-reporting feature, the Phishing Reporter will appear in the Outlook ribbon.&#x20;

When your users click the Phishing Reporter to report an email, they can provide your IT team with an early warning about potential threats. You can receive reported emails in the Microsoft 365 Defender platform and the Keepnet Incident Responder page.&#x20;

To learn how to install the Microsoft Ribbon Phishing Reporter and how your users can use the Phishing Reporter in their mail clients, see the sections below.

If you use the phishing feature in the Keepnet Incident Responder menu, the Microsoft Ribbon Phishing Reporter will also track if your users report our simulated phishing emails. You can use this feature to see which users successfully identify potential threats.

## Microsoft Ribbon Phishing Reporter User Experience

Here is an example view of the ribbon phishing reporter on Outlook.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image4.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* When using the new Outlook Ribbon, clicking the Phishing Report button opens a pop-up window instead of a side panel.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image10.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* The pop-up provides the same reporting options but appears as a temporary dialog in the center of the screen.
* This is the default experience for some Outlook versions, including Outlook on Windows with the new Ribbon UI.

## Troubleshooting Microsoft Ribbon Phishing Reporter

### We were unable to process this item. Please try again later.

**"We were unable to process this item. Please try again later."** message in the Ribbon Phishing Reporter in Outlook.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/phish report ribbon error.png" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>We were unable to process this item issue on Microsoft Ribbon Phishing Reporter</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

The suggested solution is to "[Toggling on New Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/toggle-out-of-the-new-outlook-for-windows-ec102b39-5727-418e-ae1f-a1805434640c)"

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/phishing reporter new outlook toggling.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Toggling on New Outlook</p></figcaption></figure>

It is recommended because:

1. **Compatibility Issues with Classic Outlook**

* The Microsoft Ribbon Phishing Reporter add-in might not be fully supported or optimized in the classic (legacy) Outlook for Windows **except Version 2404 (Build 17530.15000).** See [Supported Clients](microsoft-ribbon-phishing-reporter.md#supported-clients)
* Microsoft is shifting support toward New Outlook, which has improved integration with cloud-based services and add-ins.

2. **Performance & Connectivity Fixes in New Outlook**

* New Outlook is built on a web-based architecture, offering better compatibility with Microsoft 365 cloud services, including phishing reporting.
* It resolves time-out errors caused by outdated local add-in frameworks.

3. **Bug Fixes & Updates**

* Microsoft frequently updates the New Outlook, while the classic version may have outdated code that affects add-in performance.

4. **Cloud Integration & Service Connectivity**

* The Phishing Reporter add-in relies on Microsoft 365 cloud APIs to submit reports.
* If the classic Outlook version struggles with these connections, switching to the New Outlook can ensure a more stable connection.

**Try Enabling "New Outlook"** as suggested.

### Troubleshooting: Microsoft Graph Authentication Error (AADSTS530004)

The following issue occurs because **Microsoft Conditional Access** requires devices or sessions to be compliant before granting access to protected resources. When the **Keepnet Phishing Reporter** **add-in** attempts to connect via **Delegated Access** (i.e., on behalf of a signed-in user), the organizationâ€™s Conditional Access policies may block the request if it does not originate from a compliant or trusted device.

This is common when:

* The organization enforces device compliance via Intune or Azure AD.
* The user accessing the Phishing Reporter add-in is considered an external identity.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-10-21 at 16.05.58.png" alt="Screenshot reference of the error:" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### What Is Application-Level Access?

**Application-level permissions** allow the **Keepnet Phishing Reporter add-in** to access Microsoft 365 mailboxes and perform phishing reporting tasks **without requiring a signed-in user**. The add-in authenticates using its own identity instead of a userâ€™s.

When enabled, the Phishing Reporter add-in acts as a **trusted service** with organization-wide permissions granted by an administrator. This ensures that Keepnet can operate under Conditional Access, perform automated operations, and maintain consistent behavior even when users are not logged in.

#### Delegated vs Application-Level Access

<table><thead><tr><th width="140.97265625">Access Type</th><th width="213.6640625">Description</th><th width="131.3828125">Scope</th><th>Typical Use Case</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Delegated Access</td><td>Add-in acts on behalf of a user, limited by that userâ€™s permissions.</td><td>User-based</td><td>When a user reports a phishing email from Outlook.</td></tr><tr><td>Application-Level Access</td><td>Add-in acts as itself, using admin-granted permissions.</td><td>Tenant-wide</td><td>When the Phishing Reporter add-in performs identity mapping, mailbox scans, or Conditional Access operations.</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Why Application-Level Access Is Required

If your organization enforces **Conditional Access**, **device compliance**, or **automated identity** **checks**, Delegated Access will fail because it depends on the userâ€™s compliance state.

**Application-Level Access** ensures:

* **Uninterrupted operation** of the Phishing Reporter add-in across all mailboxes.
* **Centralized and consistent access** across departments and tenants.
* **Secure authentication** compatible with Conditional Access requirements.

#### When to Use Application-Level Access

Use Application-Level Access if:

* You require organization-wide authentication for all users.
* Conditional Access or advanced identity enforcement is active.
* Consistency across departments/regions is needed.

#### Security Notes

* **Admin Consent Required:** Only global administrators can grant Application-Level permissions.
* **Least Privilege Principle:** Assign only the permissions needed for the Phishing Reporter add-in to operate.
* **Governance:** Regularly audit app-only permissions to ensure compliance.

#### Keepnet Recommendation

Use **Application-Level Access** for:

* Reliable, organization-wide authentication and identity mapping.
* Compatibility with Conditional Access and advanced identity controls.

Keep **Delegated Access** for:

* End-user actions like phishing report submission from the Outlook ribbon.

#### Additional References

* [Microsoft Docs: Conditional Access and Compliant Devices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/policy-all-users-device-compliance)
* [Microsoft Docs: On-Behalf-Of Flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow)

#### Summary

This error (AADSTS530004) indicates that your Microsoft 365 tenant blocks delegated access under Conditional Access rules.

To resolve it, configure Application-Level Access (App-only) for the Keepnet Phishing Reporter add-in and reauthorize the application with admin consent

### **Q: Why can't I report multiple emails at the same time in Classic Outlook on Windows?**

A: In **classic Outlook on Windows**, the **Phishing Reporter** processes one reported message at a time. If you attempt to report another email while the first one is still being processed, a **notification dialog** will appear, informing you that the previous report is still in progress.

To report multiple emails, please wait for the current report to complete before submitting the next one. This limitation ensures that each report is properly processed without conflicts.

### Q: What Permissions are Required for Microsoft Graph API&#x20;

A: The **Microsoft Ribbon Phishing Reporter** requires specific Microsoft Graph API permissions to function effectively within an organizationâ€™s Microsoft 365 environment.

Below is a breakdown of the permissions required and their purpose:

**1. Mail Permissions**

* **Mail.Read**: Allows the Phishing Reporter to read the userâ€™s email to retrieve necessary email details such as headers, attachments, and content.
* **Mail.Read.Shared**: Extends read access to shared mailboxes, ensuring that the application can retrieve phishing emails reported from shared accounts.
* **Mail.ReadWrite**: Provides both read and write access to the userâ€™s mailbox, enabling modifications or tagging of emails as needed.
* **Mail.ReadWrite.Shared**: Extends read and write permissions to shared mailboxes for better handling of phishing reports.
* **Mail.Send**: Enables the application to send emails, which may be necessary when forwarding reported phishing emails.
* **Mail.Send.Shared**: Allows the application to send emails from shared mailboxes when the user has the appropriate permissions.
