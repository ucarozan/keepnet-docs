# Microsoft Page View Phishing Reporter

The **Microsoft** **Page View Phishing Reporter** is a Microsoft Outlook add-in developed by Keepnet that enables your users to quickly and securely report suspicious emails with a single clickâ€”directly from their email view pane. This helps your organization detect threats early and respond to phishing attempts more effectively.

### Which Outlook Platforms and Browsers Are Supported?

The **Microsoft** **Page View Phishing Reporter** is built using the Microsoft Graph API and is designed to provide a seamless, modern experience across **all major Outlook platforms**. Unlike the traditional [Microsoft Ribbon Phishing Reporter](microsoft-ribbon-phishing-reporter.md) that appears in the toolbar, the Page View version is **embedded directly within the email view pane**, providing a more integrated user interface.

[Click here](./#comparison-ribbon-vs-page-view-vs-msi-outlook-phishing-reporter-microsoft-365) to view the list of compatible Outlook platforms that support the Microsoft Page View Phishing Reporter.

This cross-platform and cross-browser support ensures that your users can report suspicious emails **consistently and securely on Outlook platforms**, regardless of the device or environment theyâ€™re using.

## Where Are Reported Emails Sent?

When a user clicks the **Phishing Reporter** button, **the** **reported suspicious email** **is sent** to one or more destinations, depending on your organization's needs:

* ðŸ“Œ **Microsoft 365 Defender portal**\
  Emails can be submitted directly to Microsoft for further analysis and contribution to spam/phishing intelligence (optional setup). Please refer to [this document](../integrating-microsoft-defender-with-keepnet-phishing-reporter.md) for setup.
* ðŸ“Œ **SOC or IT team's inbox**\
  The reported email can be forwarded to your designated inbox for internal analysis and response (optional setup). Please [visit here](../phishing-reporter-customization.md#email-settings) for more information.
* ðŸ“Œ **Keepnet Incident Responder** _(if licensed)_\
  If your organization uses [Keepnetâ€™s Incident Responder](../../incident-responder/), the reported email is also logged in the portal for case management, automated response, and automated analysis.

This flexible approach allows your organization to respond quickly to threats using your preferred tools and workflows.

## What Happens When Users Report Simulated Emails?

If you are running simulated phishing campaigns such as [**Phishing Simulator**](../../phishing-simulator/), [Callback Simulator](../../callback-simulator/), [Quishing Simulator ](../../quishing-simulator/)through Keepnet, the **Phishing Reporter** can automatically detect and log when a user reports a simulated phishing emails.&#x20;

This allows you to:

* Track individual user performance,
* Identify who successfully recognized phishing simulation campaign emails, and
* Generate behavior-based metrics for awareness training.

This feature helps improve your organizationâ€™s overall security posture by providing **real-time insight into user vigilance**. Please see the following hint for the **'real-time insights into user vigilance'** explanation.

{% hint style="info" %}
If the **"Turn off email forwarding for reported Phishing Simulation Emails"** option is enabled by the admin while customizing the phishing reporter button, a pop-up message will appear thanking the user for their awareness each time they report simulation emails, reinforcing positive behavior.  Please [see here](../phishing-reporter-customization.md#add-in-settings) for more information about this option.
{% endhint %}

## What Happens When an Employee Reports an Email

When an employee uses the **Page View Phishing Reporter Add-in** to report a suspicious email, the reported email will be sent with a detailed report directly to your designated SOC or IT email address.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you purchased the [Keepnet Incident Responder](../../incident-responder/) product, the email will also be sent for automated analysis, automated response, and case management.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-05-22 at 17.38.50.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The email that is sent to the SOC/IT team inbox includes:

* The attached **original email** as an `.eml or .msg` file
* The attached **full message header of the original reported email** as a `headers.txt` file
* The **reporting reason** selected by the employee (e.g., spam, phishing, unsure)
* Any **additional comments** the employee entered in the message box

This structured report helps your security team quickly understand the context and take action, without needing to follow up with the reporting user.

#### Understanding Required Microsoft Graph API Permissions&#x20;

The **Microsoft Page View Phishing Reporter** requires specific Microsoft Graph API permissions to function effectively within an organizationâ€™s Microsoft 365 environment. These permissions allow the application to interact with usersâ€™ emails, retrieve necessary details for reporting phishing attempts, and ensure smooth integration with the email infrastructure.&#x20;

Below is a breakdown of the permissions required and their purpose:

**1. Mail Permissions**

* **Mail.Read**: Allows the Phishing Reporter to read the userâ€™s email to retrieve necessary email details such as headers, attachments, and content.
* **Mail.Read.Shared**: Extends read access to shared mailboxes, ensuring that the application can retrieve phishing emails reported from shared accounts.
* **Mail.ReadWrite**: Provides both read and write access to the userâ€™s mailbox, enabling modifications or tagging of emails as needed.
* **Mail.ReadWrite.Shared**: Extends read and write permissions to shared mailboxes for better handling of phishing reports.
* **Mail.Send**: Enables the application to send emails, which may be necessary when forwarding reported phishing emails.
* **Mail.Send.Shared**: Allows the application to send emails from shared mailboxes when the user has the appropriate permissions.

**2. User Profile Permissions**

* **profile**: Allows the Microsoft Page View Phishing Reporter to retrieve basic user profile information, ensuring accurate reporting and tracking.

## Why Do Some Users See a Popup or Redirection?

When using Keepnetâ€™s Phishing Reporter, most users can report phishing emails with a single click â€” seamlessly and silently. However, some users may occasionally see a popup window or get redirected briefly to Microsoftâ€™s login screen.

This behavior is expected, safe, and part of Microsoftâ€™s secure authentication process.

#### What Is Supposed to Happen?

Keepnetâ€™s Phishing Reporter is designed to authenticate users automatically in the background. In most cases, if the user is already signed into Microsoft 365, the system can confirm their identity silently without any additional steps.

#### So Why Is There Sometimes a Pop-up or Redirection?

A small number of users may see a sign-in prompt because:

* **They havenâ€™t used the add-in before,** and the system needs their permission
* **Their Microsoft 365 session has expired,** and reauthentication is required
* **Their browser or security settings block silent sign-in,** which is common in private/incognito mode or stricter corporate environments
* **Microsoft requires additional verification,** such as multi-factor authentication
* **Theyâ€™re on a new device or browser** that Microsoft doesnâ€™t recognize

In any of these cases, the system must briefly show a popup or redirect them to sign in securely before proceeding.

#### Will This Happen Every Time?

No. Once a user has signed in and given the necessary permissions, their session is remembered. They typically wonâ€™t be asked to sign in again unless:

* Their session expires (after days or weeks)
* Company policy or security tools clear their session
* New permissions are requested

#### Bottom Line

Popups or redirections are not errors â€” theyâ€™re part of Microsoftâ€™s secure identity verification process. They ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data and perform actions like reporting emails.&#x20;

Keepnet follows Microsoftâ€™s best practices to provide the most seamless experience possible, while maintaining strict security and compliance.
