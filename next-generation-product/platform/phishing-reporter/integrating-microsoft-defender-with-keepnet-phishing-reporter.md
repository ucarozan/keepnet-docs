# Integrating Microsoft Defender with Keepnet Phishing Reporter

This integration allows your employees to report suspicious emails using the [**Keepnet** **Phishing** **Reporter**](./) button, forwarding them to both your **SOC team** and **Microsoft Defender**. Additionally, reported emails are sent to [**Keepnet’s** **Incident** **Responder**](../incident-responder/), enabling deeper analysis and enhanced tracking while maintaining your current reporting workflow.

**Key Benefits:**

* **Dual Reporting:** Emails reported via the Keepnet Phishing Reporter button are forwarded to both **Microsoft Defender** and **Keepnet’s Incident Responder** (if Incident Responder is purchased) for comprehensive threat analysis.
* **SOC/IT Reporting:** Reported emails are also delivered to the **SOC/IT team's mailbox** for manual review and internal investigation.
* **Simulation Tracking:** During phishing simulations, Keepnet tracks users who report simulation emails, enabling administrators to measure awareness and deliver targeted training.

You can use the Keepnet Reporter button exclusively or alongside the Microsoft Button — we recommend using only the Keepnet Reporter button, as it offers the same capabilities.
{% endhint %}

## Steps to Set Up the Integration

Please follow the steps below.

1. Log in using your global admin credentials and navigate to the [**Microsoft 365 Defender portal**](https://security.microsoft.com) > **Investigation & Response > Actions & Submissions > Submissions.**
2. Click the [**User reported settings** ](https://security.microsoft.com/securitysettings/userSubmission)option in the right-hand panel.
3. In the '**Send reported items to:'** section, please select the '**Microsoft and my reporting mailbox'** option.
4. In the '**Add an Exchange Online mailbox to send reported messages to:'** field, enter the email address, such as your **SecOps mailbox** or **a Shared email address**. If you don't have an email address, please create a shared mailbox.
5. Click the **Save** button to apply changes.

After you have configured these settings in **Microsoft 365 Defender**, you’ll now need to configure the rest of the settings in the **Keepnet platform** under the **Phishing Reporter** menu.

* Log in to the **Keepnet platform**.
* From the left menu, click **Phishing Reporter**, then go to **Settings**.
* Customize your **Phishing** **Reporter** button as needed.
* After customization, click on the **Email Settings** tab and follow the steps below:
  * Enable the **Microsoft 365 Defender Integration** option.
  * In the '**Defender Submission Email'** field, **enter the same address used in step 6** of the **Microsoft Defender configuration**.
  * **Optionally**, if you also want the **SOC team** to receive reported suspicious emails in their inboxes, please enable the **'Information Email'** option and complete the required fields.
* After configuring these, click **MANAGE AND DOWNLOAD**.
* Click the **CONNECT** button to authorize **Graph API** access, so **Keepnet** **Phishing** **Reporter** can work with your Microsoft 365.
* Upon successful authorization:
  * Download the **Ribbon** or **Page View** version of the reporter button as an **XML** file.
  * Follow the deployment steps below to add the button to users’ Outlook apps.

You can now deploy the **Keepnet** **Phishing** **Reporter** button to **test groups** or **all users** using one of the following methods:

1. [**Deploy Microsoft Ribbon Phishing Reporter**](phishing-reporter-deployment/microsoft-ribbon-phishing-reporter.md)
2. **Suggested:** [**Deploy Microsoft Page View Phishing Reporter**](phishing-reporter-deployment/microsoft-page-view-phishing-reporter.md)

## What Happens When a User Reports a Suspicious Email?

When an employee reports a **suspicious email** using the **Keepnet Phishing Reporter**, the following workflow is triggered:

1. The reported email is sent to **Microsoft Defender** under the [**Submissions**](https://security.microsoft.com/securitysettings/userSubmission) page for automated analysis.
2. The email is simultaneously forwarded to **Keepnet Incident Responder** (if licensed) for advanced case management, automated triage, and analysis.
3. The same reported email is also sent to **SOC/IT teams** (if enabled), as well as any configured **CC or BCC** recipients, for manual investigation and review.

{% hint style="info" %}
Microsoft’s **Submissions** page does not support emails containing multiple attachments. For example, files like header.txt will not be included when forwarded to Microsoft Defender. Only the original email  will be analyzed by Microsoft Defender.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Processing Time:** Once an employee reports an email, the email will appear on your **Microsoft 365 Defender > Submissions** page in a few minutes.
{% endhint %}
