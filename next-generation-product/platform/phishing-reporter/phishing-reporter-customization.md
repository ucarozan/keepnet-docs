### Diagnostic Tool

The **Diagnostic** **Tool** provides information about the status of the add-in by sending the statistics of the add-in to the platform regularly. The advanced level of awareness presented makes distribution and regulation of the add-in easier for system admins. For example, if the add-in has been disabled by a user or for any reason, the tool can be used to ensure automatic activation or report the situation to the platform for system admins to be aware of this case.

{% hint style="warning" %}
