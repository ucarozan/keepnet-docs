## Troubleshoot

If you’re unable to start an ETS scan on an O365 email account, follow these steps to troubleshoot:

1. **Check Sign-In Logs**: Navigate to the **User Sign-In** logs for the email account used for the ETS scan. Review the logs to identify any technical issues preventing Keepnet from connecting to the account.
2. **Verify MFA/2FA Settings**: Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is disabled for the email account used for the ETS scan.
3. **Allow Time for Settings to Apply**: After configuring the account settings according to the documentation, wait at least 60 minutes before initiating the ETS scan. Microsoft may require some time to apply the changes across your organization.

If you still can't start an ETS scan on the email account, please [contact the support team](../../../resources/keepnet-support-help-desk.md) for further assistance.
