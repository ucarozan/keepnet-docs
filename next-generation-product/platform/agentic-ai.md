# Agentic AI

**Agentic AI** is Keepnet’s **agent-based product** for running security awareness at scale. It’s **not a chatbot** or a chat-only tool. Instead, it coordinates multiple AI agents to drive a continuous improvement loop: **plan, create, deliver, measure, and improve** your security awareness program.

**Agentic AI** generates and optimizes **microlearning content** and **phishing simulation scenarios** using behavioral science and your organization’s context. Outputs adapt to **roles and responsibilities**, **observed behavior signals** (such as reporting rates, simulation outcomes, and risk indicators), and **training performance**, so the right content reaches the right audience at the right time.

**Agentic AI** is also **multilingual**, enabling global teams to work and generate outputs in the languages they use.

## Overview

### What you can achieve with Agentic AI

Agentic AI helps security teams move from manual content production to a continuous improvement cycle (plan → create → deliver → measure → improve).

You can use it to:

* Reduce risk driven by human behavior by focusing on the behaviors that lead to incidents.
* Generate training content and phishing simulations in minutes instead of starting from scratch.
* Improve consistency across departments, regions, and languages.
* Align outputs to internal standards by using uploaded PDFs as reference materials.

### Why IT teams typically adopt it

For IT and Security teams, the value is practical:

* Less manual work creating campaign content and training drafts
* Faster response to evolving social engineering tactics (new scenarios and microlearning on demand)
* Governance-focused AI adoption with enterprise-grade controls

## Licensing and Access

### License requirement (required)

Your company must have an **Agentic AI license** to use this product. If you do not have a license, contact: [**sales@keepnetlabs.com**](mailto:sales@keepnetlabs.com)

### Who can see and use Agentic AI

By default, Agentic AI is available to:

* **Reseller**
* **Company Admin** (when licensed)

If your tenant uses **custom system roles**, your admin can allow or deny access based on your role permissions.

1. Go to **Dashboard**.
2. Click **Agentic AI** in the **top-right corner**.
3. The Agentic AI panel opens.

If you don’t see Agentic AI, it’s typically due to missing license entitlement or role permissions.
{% endhint %}

### Panel controls

* **Menu (☰)**: access chats and Files
* **Search (🔍)**: quick actions like New chat and theme selection (Light/Dark/System)
* **Expand (▢)**: maximize the panel to full screen
* **Close (✕)**: close the panel

### Create a new chat

Use **New chat** to keep workstreams separate, for example:

* “Microlearning drafts”
* “Phishing scenarios for Finance”
* “Behavior insights and actions”

## Core Capabilities

### Generate Microlearning

Create short, practical microlearning content for your target audience. This supports behavior change by improving content over time based on outcomes and signals.

**Example prompts**

* “Create microlearning about QR phishing for frontline staff. Keep it short and practical.”
* “Rewrite this as a 5-bullet checklist.”
* “Make this suitable for executives, formal tone, under 120 words.”

### Analyze User Behavior

Turn behavior signals into actionable insights. Agentic AI is designed to work with **anonymized behavior attributes** such as training outcomes, simulation outcomes, reporting behavior, role, region, language, and culture.

**Example prompts**

* “Summarize the riskiest behaviors and recommend the top 3 actions for next month.”
* “Which department needs the most attention and why? Provide 3 actions.”
* “Draft a short message for managers to reinforce reporting suspicious emails.”

### Design Phishing Scenario

Generate phishing simulation scenarios based on your goals and constraints, supported by safety layers designed to reduce unsafe or inaccurate output.

**Example prompts**

* “Create a phishing scenario targeting finance users using invoice urgency. Include learning goals and safe wording.”
* “Generate 3 variants with increasing difficulty.”
* “Create a scenario aligned to our internal phishing policy (use uploaded PDFs as references).”

## Upload Company Documents (PDFs)

### Why upload documents?

The **Files** area lets you upload company PDFs, so Agentic AI can better align outputs with your:

* internal policies and standards,
* approved tone and terminology,
* security awareness requirements.

Common PDFs to upload:

* phishing simulation policy
* security awareness policy
* acceptable use policy
* internal writing or style guidelines

### Upload rules

* **PDF only**
* **Maximum file size:** **500 MB**

### Delete uploaded documents

You can delete uploaded PDFs from the Files page using the **Delete** action.

## Security, Privacy, and Governance

Agentic AI is designed for enterprise use, with governance-focused controls.

### Data minimization and PII protection

* **No PII is sent to the AI system.** PII stays within your tenant boundary and is removed before AI requests (Data Minimizer Engine).
* The system is designed to use **anonymized behavioral attributes** (training/simulation outcomes, reporting behavior, role, region, language, culture).

### Encryption and data residency

* **TLS 1.2+** in transit and **AES-256** at rest
* Customer data stays in the selected **Microsoft Azure region**

### OpenAI retention and training

Azure OpenAI is configured for **no data retention and no training** (enterprise configuration).

### Safety and quality controls

Keepnet uses layered controls designed to reduce unsafe or incorrect output, including:

* **RAG** to ground outputs in verified sources
* **Cloudflare AI Gateway** for filtering and governance
* Keepnet validation layers and optional human approval workflows

#### Retention and deletion (high level)

Governance documentation describes:

* Audit log retention: **7 years** (configurable)
* GDPR erasure requests: **30-day SLA**
* Backup deletion: **60-day cycle**
* Certificate of destruction available on request
