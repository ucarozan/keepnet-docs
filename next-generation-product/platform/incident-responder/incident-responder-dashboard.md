<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="150"></th><th width="582.1428571428571"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Average hours saved per reported email(hours)</td><td>You can enter how much time a SOC team member spends time on each reported suspicious email to analyze, investigate, delete or other such actions.</td></tr><tr><td>Average total cost per hour($)</td><td>You can enter how much money it cost the company when a SOC team member spends time (hours) on each reported suspicious email to analyze, investigate, delete or other such actions.</td></tr></tbody></table>

An example from real life scenario. There is a **SOC team** who has **five members** and only **one person** is dedicated to taking these **"analyze, share results with the reporter, investigate, delete phishing email"** actions of **each** **email** reported by employees.&#x20;

The person spends approximately **one** **hour** on each email, and depending on the salary, the person's one hour is equal to **200$** to the compan&#x79;**,** then set the **"average hours = 1 hour"** and set the **"average total cost = 200$"** in the widget settings.

The product will calculate based on this information how much money and time is saved by using the Incident Responder based on the each reported email to the product.

## **Use Cases**

### **SOAR Integration**

In case the end user reports an email, the relevant email is analyzed by the services with which the Incident Responder product is integrated. If the analysis result appears to be malicious, the institution's SOC team will apply additional measures such as using antivirus, firewall, EDR, proxy etc. to target this malicious email. This manual process will take a lot of time and will delay the intervention to the incident in a timely manner.

If the email reported to the platform is determined to be phishing or malicious after analysis, your current SOAR solution can obtain this detail from the platform via API and automatically perform the necessary actions on your solutions such as EDR, Proxy, and Firewall. In this way, the process will be manageable due to the quick action taken. API usage details are explained in detail in this document.

## **FAQ**

### **Q: Can I delete incident records from the platform?**

A: You can update the status of the incidents as “closed”, but the incident cannot be deleted from the interface.

### **Q: Are the actions I take in the cluster view applied to all cases in the cluster?**

A: Yes, the actions you take in the cluster view are effective in all the cases.

### Q: What will happen if the email I reported is detected to be malicious?

A: If the analysis determines the data as malicious or phishing, an automatic investigation is launched, and any suspicious emails detected in other mailboxes are scanned. Additionally, you can also take steps like Investigate and Re-Analyze.

### **Q: Is the reported email sent to another service?**

A: No, the email reported by your users is never sent to any other service.

### Q: Does automatic analysis start when the analysis result of the reported email is Phishing, Malicious or Undetected?

A: Automatic analysis starts only when the analysis result is determined to be Phishing and Malicious, and the relevant malicious email is automatically searched throughout the company.

### **Q: How Sandbox analyzes my suspicious emails?**

A: We analyze suspicious email by header, body and attachments using our third-party analysis engines integrated into our platform. The reported email itself is not forwarded to the integrations. Our platform parses the URL, Attachment and Sender IP and makes the analysis.

### Q: Can I integrate the reported emails with my SOAR products by obtaining the details using the API?

A: You can perform almost every operation in the Incident Responder product using API. You can refer to our Rest API [document](https://api.keepnetlabs.com/docs/index.html) to see the details.

### **Q: Are the emails sent by users for analysis securely stored on the server?**

A: The platform generates a random key that is unique for each customer, then encrypts all reported emails on disk with AES 256 algorithm.

### **Q: How does the Incident Responder handle redirected URLs?**

A: Incident Responder product extracts and scans every domain in the redirection chain, starting from the main domain and continuing through each redirection step until the final destination is reached.

### Q: How does the Incident Responder handle the QR code emails?

A:  Incident Responder product extracts and scans the QR codes by default. It can scan the QR code that is added to the body of the email or attached.&#x20;

### **Q: Why doesn't Keepnet automatically start an investigation when an email is marked as malicious?**

A: If the _Incident Responder_ initially marks an email as _Undetected_ and you later change it to _Malicious_ or _Phishing_, Keepnet does not start an automatic investigation.

This is because emails often contain multiple elements (attachments, URLs, sender IPs), and the system cannot determine which one is actually malicious. Investigating all elements could lead to false positives and unnecessary alerts.

To ensure accuracy, we suggest starting a manual investigation to focus on the specific malicious attachment or phishing link.

### **Q: Does Incident Responder support analyzing emails reported with IPv6 Sender IP addresses?**

A: Yes. Incident Responder fully supports detecting and analyzing IPv6 addresses included as Sender IPs in reported emails, enabling comprehensive investigations of emails originating from IPv6 IP addresses.
