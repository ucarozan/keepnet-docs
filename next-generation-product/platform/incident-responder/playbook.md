# Playbook

The Incident Responder Playbook feature is used to create rules that automate the analysis and incident response to suspicious emails, which saves valuable time.

The Playbook rules will work only if the reported email matches the condition in the rules.

<table><thead><tr><th width="152.54879972451124"></th><th width="581.1428571428571"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Rule Name*</td><td>Name of the playbook rule</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>More information/detailed description of the playbook rule</td></tr><tr><td>Priority</td><td>Priority level of the playbook rule</td></tr><tr><td>Tags</td><td>Tags related to the playbook rule</td></tr><tr><td>Active</td><td>Status of the playbook rule: active or passive</td></tr></tbody></table>
