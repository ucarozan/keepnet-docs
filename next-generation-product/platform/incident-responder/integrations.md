# Integrations

This section explains the functions of **Incident Responder > Integrations**. The Incident Responder product can be used to perform simple tasks like adding a new integration, modifying, deactivating, and deleting the existing integration.

To access every section of this document, go to the **Incident Responder > Integrations** menu.

## **Integrations**

The components of the Integrations page are:

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="150"></th><th width="582.2051282051282"></th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Integration Name</td><td>Name of the Integration.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Integration Type</td><td>Type of the Integration.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>Description of the integration.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Status</td><td>The status information of the integration. (Active, Inactive)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Date Created</td><td>The date of the integration creation.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Actions</td><td>You can edit the selected integration. You can change the status or delete the integration by clicking the "︙" button.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Creating New Integration**

If you want to add an integration for the first time, click the **New** button (on the middle of the page), if there is an integration that has been added before, click the **New** button (in the upper right corner of the page).

You can create a new integration by following the steps in the table below.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="150"></th><th width="582.1428571428571"></th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Integration Name</td><td>Name of the Integration.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>Description of the integration.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Integration Type</td><td>Select an integration type.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>API URL</td><td>The API URL address of the integration type. The VirusTotal, Google Safe Browsing, Zen Spamhaus, IBM X-Force, Opswat, Google Web Risk, VMRay, AnyRun, and Cyber X-Ray analysis engines have API URLs by default on the platform and changing the domain may cause disfunction.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Tags</td><td>Labeling function. Integrations defined in the system can be filtered more easily by labeling them.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Proxy</td><td>You can choose the proxy server that the platform will use for the connections to the integration. If not, leave <strong>Default</strong>.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>URLs</td><td>URL analysis capability is enabled by default, you can disable it if needed.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Sender IP</td><td>Sender IP analysis capability is active by default, you can disable it if needed.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Attachments</td><td>File analysis capability is active by default, you can disable it if needed.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Status</td><td>Integration is active by default, you can disable the integration if needed.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Advanced Settings**

If there are emails that you do not want to be analyzed in the [Incident Responder](https://keepnetlabs.com/products/incident-responder), you can exclude them from analysis by adding their IP addresses, URL addresses, and File Extensions to this menu. Using this feature, you can ensure that secure IP addresses, domains, and file extensions are not analyzed. Thus, API limits used in integrations are utilized more efficiently.

You can access this feature from the **Advanced Settings** page on the **Incident Responder > Integration** menu.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="150"></th><th width="585.1428571428571"></th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>URLs</td><td>Exclude URL addresses in a reported email from the analysis.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>IP Addresses</td><td>Exclude the IP address of a reported email server and the IP addresses included as URLs in the email from the analysis.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Attachments</td><td>Exclude file extensions in a reported email from the analysis.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
