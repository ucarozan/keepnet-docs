## **How to Start an Investigation?**

### **Auto Investigation**

Click on **Incident Responder > Investigation** menu to access **Auto Investigation** and report details.

If the analysis result of an email in the **Reported Emails** is determined as **Malicious or Phishing**,  an automatic investigation is launched to search for the email within all users’ inboxes. The administrator will then decide what to do with the next steps.

{% hint style="info" %}
Auto Investigation starts automatically by default as a result of a malicious email analysis.
{% endhint %}

When an **Auto investigation** or **Manual investigation** is started, platform admins are informed about the details of the process via email.

### Starting a Manual Investigation

Click the **Incident Responder > Investigation** menu to start **Manual Investigation** and access the report details.

With the **Manual** **Investigation** feature, platform administrators can detect suspicious emails within their employees' email boxes using the criteria in the table below.
