## FAQ&#x20;

### Q: Is it possible to remove the phishing simulation email from target users’ inboxes once the campaign has been launched?

A: Yes. The investigation feature of the Incident Responder product gives you the capability to delete the phishing simulation email.

### Q: Can I change the date and time of the campaign after it has been scheduled?

A: Yes. You can adjust the campaign settings at any time before the launch date.

### Q: Is there a way to exclude phishing campaigns from showing up in the reports section, for example, if they were launched for testing purposes?
