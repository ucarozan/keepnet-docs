* Click on the **+NEW** button on the **Callback Templates** page.
* On the **Template Info** page, complete the following fields:
  * **Select the difficulty level:** The difficulty rating for the template
  * **Template name:** Name of the callback template

* Click **Next**
* On the **Dialog Settings** page complete the following fields:
  * Select the **Language and Voice** that the callback template will be voiced in
  * Enter a message for the **Caller** **Greeting**. The caller is expected to enter a 6-digit phishing code at the end of the call greeting message.
  * Enter the **Steps** that define your callback template
    * Select **Text-To-Speech** or **MP3** steps to create your callback campaign.
      * **Text-to-speech:** The text written by the admin will be narrated by the AI in the chosen language and voice.
      * **MP3 Audio File:** The mp3 voice file will be played to the end user.
      * **Pause:** The call will be held on in silence in seconds after the previous step is completed before the second step is played.
    * Next, enter the number of number digits that the end user will have to enter to move on to the next step.
      * Leave by default zero if no required digit must be dialed by the end user for the related step.
    * You need to choose one step, “**Digit Entering Step**”, in order to mark the end user as phished on the report if the user comes to the related marked step.
    * Finally, complete the fields for **Invalid Dialing Notice.** This notice will be played when the user fails to enter the requested amount of digits correctly.
      * Under **Methods**, select if you would like to use voice to text or if you would like to upload an mp3 file.
        * If you select the **voice-to-text** option, enter the text for the AI to narrate
* Once you are happy with your template, click **Save**.
