## FAQ

### Why does an SMS go to the spam folder when I launch an SMS phishing campaign?

1. A phishing URL could cause the SMS simulation to be marked as spam.
2. The phone number was reported as suspicious.
3. Keywords that impersonate big names, like Microsoft or Outlook, etc.

#### Solutions:

1. Test your Smishing simulation campaign on various GSM providers to ensure it is not marked as spam.
2. If it goes to spam, first check the URL to ensure it doesn't look suspicious. For example, outlook.company.com is suspicious; use email-login.company.com instead.
3. Change the sender phone number to use a number never detected as suspicious by carriers.

### How do you ensure that messages arrived at destination?&#x20;

Yes, we provide delivery reports in real time. You can make sure the phone number has got the SMS test or failed to delivery with reason by following the [Smishing Report > Sending Report > Delivery Status](smishing-campaign-reports.md#sending-report)

### Which protocols are used for the exchange of SMS?&#x20;

The primary protocols used for the exchange of SMS messages include SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) and HTTP/HTTPS for API communications. SMPP is a standard protocol for exchanging SMS messages between SMS peer entities such as short message service centers, while HTTP/HTTPS protocols are used for API-based interactions, enabling secure communication over the internet.&#x20;

### Do you have any document testifying that all data collected is destructed after a certain amount of time?&#x20;

Keepnet adheres to strict data privacy and security protocols, ensuring that all collected data is managed responsibly. According to our [data retention policy](../../../resources/compliance.md#data-retention-and-disposal-procedure), all data collected through our services, including the SMS phishing simulator, is securely destroyed after a predetermined period, in compliance with applicable data protection regulations.
