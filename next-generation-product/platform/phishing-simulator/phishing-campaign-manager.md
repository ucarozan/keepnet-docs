# Phishing Campaign Manager

A phishing campaign can be launched to target users in two ways. The **Fast** **Launch** option allows you to initiate a phishing campaign quickly and easily, without having to designate any settings. However, if you prefer customization, advanced features are available to refine the campaign using the **Campaign** **Manager** option, such as **Schedule**, **Multiple** **Target** **Groups**, **SMTP** **Delay**, **Expire** **Date**, **Multiple** **Scenarios,** and **Randomize** to allow you to modify a variety of elements to suit your needs.&#x20;

## Campaign Manager Components

The components of the **Campaign** **Manager** page are explained below.

## How to Track People Who Reply to Phishing Simulation Emails

The "**Reply** **Tracking**" feature allows system administrators to monitor and identify users who respond to phishing simulation emails. This not only helps in evaluating employee awareness but also provides valuable insights into how users engage with suspicious emails. By understanding user behavior, organizations can tailor their training efforts and mitigate potential risks more effectively.

#### Why Use the Reply Tracking Feature?

* **Identify High-Risk Users**: Track which employees engage with phishing emails by replying, so you can provide targeted training to address their vulnerabilities.
* **Gain Behavioral Insights**: Understand what employees typically write when responding to phishing emails, which can reveal potential patterns of risky behavior.
* **Improve Security Awareness**: Use the data collected to refine your awareness campaigns and educate employees on best practices for handling suspicious emails.

#### How to Enable and Use the Reply Tracking Feature

Follow the steps below to enable and utilize this feature:

1. Navigate to **Phishing Simulator > Campaign Manager**, then click the **+ NEW** button.
2. Fill in the required fields. For more details on setting up a campaign, refer to the [beginning of the documentation](phishing-campaign-manager.md#create-a-campaign).
3. Enable the **"Reply Tracking"** option.
4. Enter a **custom email name** and **select one of the simulation domains** provided by the platform.
5. To review the content of reply emails, enable the **"Save reply email content for review"** option. This allows you to view the content of the replies directly in the campaign report.
6. Click **Next** and select the scenario you wish to launch for your employees.
7. Configure the remaining settings as needed. For detailed guidance, refer to the **"**[**Create a Campaign**](phishing-campaign-manager.md#create-a-campaign)**"** section in the documentation.

Once your campaign is live, any employee who replies to the simulation email will appear in the campaign report under the **Replied** menu. You can review the details of their replies if you have enabled the **"Save reply email content for review"** option.

For more information about campaign reports, refer to the full documentation [here](phishing-campaign-reports.md).

## **How to Launch Scenarios Based on Users’ Preferred Language**

The **Preferred Language** feature allows you to send phishing simulation scenarios in each recipient’s preferred language. If a preferred language is not set, the system will default to the company's preferred language.

#### **Setting Up Preferred Languages for Users**

Before launching a campaign with this feature, you must assign preferred languages to users:

1. Navigate to **Company > Target Users**.
2. Assign a preferred language to each user.
3. Add these users into a **Target Group**.

#### Create Multi-Language Scenario with Localization

Before creating a campaign that sends a scenario in your users’ preferred languages, make sure the scenario includes a localized **email template** and **landing page**. This ensures each employee receives both assets in their own preferred language.

1. Create or duplicate an [email template](manage-phishing-scenarios/email-templates.md#how-to-add-a-new-email-template), then add localized versions for the required languages using the **localization** feature.
2. Create or duplicate a [landing page](manage-phishing-scenarios/landing-pages.md#how-to-add-a-new-landing-page-template), then add localized versions for the required languages using the **localization** feature.
3. Create a **scenario** and add your localized email template and landing page.

You can now proceed to the next section to launch your scenario.

#### **Enabling Preferred Language in a Campaign**

To launch a campaign using this feature:

1. Navigate to **Phishing Simulator > Campaign Manager**.
2. Click the **+ NEW** button to create a new campaign.
3. In the **Hyper-Personalization** section, select:
   * **"Send in the target users’ preferred language"**\
     → The system will send scenarios in each recipient’s preferred language. If no preferred language is set, the company's default language will be used.
4. Complete the remaining campaign fields and settings as needed.
5. Click **Next** to proceed through **scenario** **selection**, **target** **groups**, and **other** **customizations**.
6. Click **Launch** to start the campaign.

#### **How Scenarios Are Assigned Based on Language**

* If a scenario template is available in the user's preferred language, they will receive that version.
* If a scenario template is not available in the user’s preferred language, the system will send the scenario in the **company’s default language**.
* If no scenario template matches either the user's preferred language or the company’s default language, the system will prompt you to select appropriate language versions before launch.

This ensures that users receive scenarios in the most relevant language for them, improving the effectiveness of phishing simulations.

## FAQ&#x20;

### Q: Is it possible to remove the phishing simulation email from target users’ inboxes once the campaign has been launched?

A: Yes. The Incident Responder investigation feature gives you the capability to delete the phishing simulation email.

### Q: Can I cancel the phishing simulation after the campaign has been launched?

A: No. You can only cancel the campaign before the launch date.

### Q: Can I change the date and time of the campaign after it has been scheduled?

A: Yes. You can adjust the campaign settings at any time before the launch date.

### Q: Is there a way to exclude phishing campaigns from showing up in the reports section, for example, if they were launched for testing purposes?

A: Yes. On the **Advanced** **Settings** tab, the **Exclude** from reports feature provides this capability.

### Q: If I select multiple scenarios for my campaign, how will the system distribute them among my employees?

A: When multiple scenarios are selected for a campaign, the distribution of emails will be calculated based on the number of users divided by the number of scenarios. For example, if you have 100 users and 4 scenarios, each scenario will be sent to 25 users.

### Q: Why do simulation emails contain the "X-MS-Exchange-Organization-SkipSafeLinksProcessing: true" header?

A: This header prevents Microsoft Defender from analyzing links in phishing simulation emails, ensuring accurate test results and preventing false positives.

### **Q: I launched a campaign with training attached and selected the 'Start Training Immediately' option. Although the user failed the simulation, their status shows as 'In Queue' in the Sending Report on the enrollment report. Why is that?**

**A:** This status occurs because the user clicked the simulation link and was redirected to the training enrollment page but did **not** click the **'START TRAINING'** button to begin the training.

Until the user actively starts the training by clicking this button, their status will remain as **'In Queue'**. Once they start the training, the status will automatically update accordingly.
