# Phishing Campaign Reports

This section describes the basic functionalities of phishing campaign reports, which you can find from the **Phishing Simulator > Campaign Manager** and click the **Instances** button to access the reports of the phishing campaign.&#x20;

Once you go inside the **Instances** of a campaign, you will see reports for that campaign; click on the **View** **Report** button under the **Actions** column to access the phishing campaign report.

## **View Report Details**

In a campaign report, there are many sub-menus that provide valuable statistics about your phishing campaign. Here are the following menus on a campaign report:

### **Summary**

The **Summary** provides a brief synopsis of the phishing scenario and options for further action.

## How Password Complexity is Calculated

When a user submits a form containing a password field, we evaluate the password using a scoring system that determines how strong or weak it is. This score is based on the structure and patterns used in the password.

{% hint style="warning" %}
We do not store or receive full user passwords. Before the form is submitted:

* Only the first character of the password is kept.
* All remaining characters are replaced with asterisks (\*), e.g. P\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*.

This ensures that no actual password is transmitted or stored, supporting both user privacy and compliance with security best practices.

Thank you — here is the final version incorporating that **bot activity may apply to both "Opened Email" and "Clicked Link" events**, and still maintaining the correct documentation format with only one Heading 2 and one Subheading 3:

## Understanding Bot Activity vs. Human Activity in Reports

In phishing campaign reports, **Human Activity** refers to real actions taken by users, such as opening emails, clicking links, or submitting data. In contrast, **Bot Activity** represents automated interactions triggered by email security systems, spam filters, or sandboxing tools. These bots scan emails and follow links as part of their protective duties—sometimes even before users see the message.

Bot activity may appear in both **Opened Email** and **Clicked Link** sections of the report. For example, if a security system opens an email to analyze it, or clicks a link to test the destination, these actions may be captured and flagged as bot interactions.

To ensure accurate reporting, the platform automatically detects and labels such activity based on predefined detection rules. Any record classified as **Bot Activity** will carry a special tag and can be excluded from the view by clicking the **“Hide Bot Activity”** button. Admins can also hover over the info (ⓘ) icon in the **Activity Type** column to see which rule was triggered.

The detection rules are:

* **A1 – Unusual User-Agent Interacted:** Triggered when an atypical or suspicious user-agent (browser identifier) is detected.
* **A2 – Honeypot Link Reused:** The hidden phishing link inside of the email clicked multiple times by the same IP and user-agent within 5 minutes—indicating automation.
* **A3 – Same-Second Activity Spike:** Multiple activities occurred at the exact same time, which is unlikely for human users.
* **A4 – Stop Bot Activity Challenge Failed:**
  * **A4.1** – The phishing link was clicked, but the invisible browser javascript challenge was not passed.
  * **A4.2** – The browser failed to load required scripts that a real user’s browser would normally execute.

If customers see several entries marked as **Bot Activity**, it typically means that their security tools pre-screened the phishing simulation links. To evaluate real user behavior, they should filter the report by **Activity Type** or use the **“Hide Bot Activity”** toggle. For better accuracy in future simulations, they may consider whitelisting Keepnet domains to reduce interference from automated systems.

By filtering out bot noise, organizations gain a clearer understanding of **true user actions and risk levels**.

## FAQ

### Q: Can I download a phishing scenario report?

A: Yes. You can download a report that provides details of the campaign by clicking on the **Download Report** button.

### Q: Can I change the content of the report of the phishing scenario?

A: No. The information in the report cannot be changed.

### Q: Can I resend the scenario to users who did not open the email?

A: Yes. The resend function allows you to send the phishing scenario to any user you select.

### Q: Can I check on the status of the campaign?

A: Yes. The Sending Report option provides you with a view of the current activity of the phishing scenario.

### Q: **Can I import reports into my own reporting tool (e.g., Qlik Sense, Tableau, PowerBI)?**

A: Yes. You can transfer all of our reports through an API, enabling you to use the information as needed to suit your business. Additional information on APIs is available [here.](../company/company-settings/rest-api.md)

### Q: What are the differences between the Only Opened Emails, Only Clicked Links vs Opened Emails and Clicked Links tabs in the downloaded excel report?

A: The differences are explained below.

* "Only Opened Emails" will show the users who only opened the email and didn't go further, such as clicking the link.
* "Only Clicked Links" will show the users who opened the email and then clicked the link and didn't go further, such as data submission.
* "Opened Emails" will show the users who opened emails. It doesn't matter if user clicked the link or submitted any data.
* "Clicked Links" will show the users who opened and then clicked the link. It doesn't matter if the user submitted any data.

### **Q:** How do you determine if a "user agent" belongs to a sandbox or a real email user?

**A:** Please see below how the **Sandbox** **Activity** **Detection** feature works to identify false positive clicks.&#x20;

1. **Rule 1: User Agent Signatures:** We have a list of 10+ sandbox user agent patterns. If a user action matches these, it's flagged as sandbox activity.
2. **Rule 2: Honeypot Link:** We embed invisible "Honeypot" links in our emails. While humans can't see or click them, sandboxes often access them, revealing their presence.
3. **Rule 3: Request Header Analysis:** By examining request headers, we can identify unique characteristics that differentiate sandbox activities from real user actions.

### Q: Some users failed to receive the simulation via DEC and show the error 'The process failed to get the correct properties.'

A: If users did not receive the simulation email via DEC and show the error 'The process failed to get the correct properties' in the Sending Report section of the campaign report, it may indicate that these users have been deleted, do not have an email license, have no inbox, or have been deactivated. Please check the users in your Microsoft 365 admin panel to ensure they are all active and have a valid mailbox license.
