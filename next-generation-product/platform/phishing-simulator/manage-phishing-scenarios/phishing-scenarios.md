These standard system scenarios are available to all clients and can be launched with just a few clicks. You also have the option to customize a scenario to your needs or to create a unique phishing campaign.

The components of the **Scenarios** page are explained below.

Keepnet uses a tiny, 1x1 pixel image from a remote URL to track when files are opened in Microsoft Office applications like Excel, Word.\
\
This method does not work with Macbook Numbers, which does not support URL-based images in cells, preventing file tracking. \
\
For broader compatibility in phishing attacks across Microsoft, Mac, and Android devices, use HTML file attachments, which support complex elements across diverse devices and software environments.

## How to Create a Scenario with Just-in-time Learning Page

The **Just-in-time Learning Page** is an intelligent feature that automatically highlights warning signs (red flags) in simulated phishing emails. It provides employees with instant, contextual training at the exact moment of risk.

To set this up, you first need to create both the **Just-in-time Learning Page** and the **Red Flag Email Template**. Once completed, you can combine them to build a phishing scenario and launch it to your employees.

## FAQs

### Q: Can I add a landing page to Attachment scenarios?

A: No. Landing pages are not supported for Attachment scenarios. These scenarios only support Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and HTML attachments. User activity is tracked when the attachment is opened or executed on the device, which is an action users should normally avoid.
