## **Utilizing JavaScript on Landing Pages**

JavaScript enhances landing pages with dynamic behavior and interactivity. This capability helps you create more engaging and realistic phishing simulations by enabling features such as:

1. **Real-time content manipulation**\
   Example: Add a countdown timer that shows “You have 30 seconds left to complete this form.” This creates urgency and makes the simulation feel more realistic.
2. **Form validation**\
   Example: When a user tries to submit a form without entering an email address, JavaScript can show a warning like: “Please enter your email before submitting.” This mimics real websites that check inputs.
3. **Conditional content display**\
   Example: Show a hidden message only if a user types in a certain keyword or clicks a specific button, such as “Access Granted” after filling a field correctly.

Please follow the steps below to use the JavaScript code editor feature.

* Go to **Phishing Simulator > Phishing Scenarios > Landing Pages**
* Click **+ NEW** to create a new landing page
* Complete the required fields on the first page, then click **Next**
* Click **Edit** at the bottom center of the page to open the landing page editor
* At the top of the editor, click **Import** to open the HTML code editor
* Inside the editor, locate the notice: _“Some scripts may be blocked for security reasons. Click here to add custom JavaScript code.”_
* Click the link to open a pop-up where you can safely insert your JavaScript
* After inserting your script, click **Save** to apply your changes and publish the landing page

You can now [create a scenario](phishing-scenarios.md) with your email template and landing page and then [launch](../phishing-campaign-manager.md) it to your email inbox to test the landing page to confirm if everything works as you expect.

## **Utilizing Merge Tags in Landing Page Templates**

## FAQs

### Can I divert employees who click the link to a URL not hosted by Keepnet?&#x20;

Yes! You can direct users to your own URL instead of using a standard Keepnet landing page. To set this up, select a Keepnet landing page, and replace the URL in the provided HTML code with the URL of your hosted landing page. Here’s how you do it:

1. Choose a Keepnet landing page for your phishing scenario.
2.  Insert the following HTML code, substituting `https://www.google.com` with your own landing page URL:

    ```html
    htmlCopy code<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="1; URL=https://www.your-landing-page.com" />
    ```

This setup will automatically redirect anyone who clicks on the link to your chosen landing page after 1 second, allowing us to track the click-through.
