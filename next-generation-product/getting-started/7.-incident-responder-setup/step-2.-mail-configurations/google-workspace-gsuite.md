| Name               | Name of the configuration                                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Credential JSON    | Open the JSON file with a text editor and copy/paste all of the information |
| Test Email Address | An active email address to be used for testing purposes                     |
| Test Connection    | Perform a test of the configuration                                         |

The new configuration will now appear in the list of mail configurations if the test was successful.

## About Permissions

### Application Programming Interface (API) Scopes

API scopes identify the information an application will be able to access on a user’s behalf.

### Permissions Required by the Platform

#### Email (read/write/send) - https://mail.google.com/

This permission allows the app access to emails in user mailboxes. Please note, it is only used to enable investigative searches; we do not create, read, edit, or send emails using this permission.

The platform uses this permission to scan and filter users' emails. For example, when the “From” filter is selected as a criterion for investigation, this authorization enables the creation of a list of the emails that meet the specified parameter. Other uses include regex and keyword searches.

This permission enables quick deletion of malicious content without compromising user privacy.

#### View Users on the Domain - /auth/admin.directory.user.readonly

This permission allows the app to read data in the organization's user directory. The platform uses this access to retrieve a client's user list and their email addresses when an investigation has been initiated.

#### Email (Manage Labels) - /auth/gmail.labels

This permission allows the app to create, read, update, and delete labels. The platform uses this authority to mark emails in the user's inbox with a warning message when the client deems this appropriate. For example, after running an investigation, you may choose to warn the user rather than delete the email results.

## FAQ

### Q: Can I start an investigation on Incident Responder without integrating Google Workspace?

A: No. In order to be able to start an investigation and take action on emails, integration with Google Workspace is required.
