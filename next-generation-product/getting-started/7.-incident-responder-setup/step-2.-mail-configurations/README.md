# Step 2. Mail Configurations

This article section describes how to integrate the [Incident Responder](https://keepnetlabs.com/products/incident-responder) module with Google Workspace, Exchange, or Microsoft Office 365 email services. It's important to follow the steps accurately. Please contact your email server administrator if you don’t have the required permissions to make these configurations.

## Benefit of Email Server Integration

The Incident Responder module investigation tool can detect malicious emails in user inboxes and remove them automatically or can be removed by the admin as well.

Server-based integration with your email service provides the most comprehensive protection. While email investigations can be conducted with the Phishing Reporter plug-in, the user must have Outlook open and the plug-in active for the investigation to be successful. If the Outlook application is closed for any reason, a complete investigation can only be performed using a server-based integration.

The server-based integration has the advantage to start an investigation at any time.
