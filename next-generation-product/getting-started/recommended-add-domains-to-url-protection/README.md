# (Recommended) Add domains to URL Protection

{% hint style="info" %}
**Why is this Optional?** Not every customer has SafeLinks or URL Protection setup. This step is only necessary for customers who use a URL Protection tool and need to allow Keepnet domains.
{% endhint %}

Without this step, your employees will successfully receive the test phishing email but not be able to open the test phishing link without your browser security notifying the user that it may be a suspicious link. For the highest accuracy when measuring employee behaviour, you will need to whitelist domains in your browser and other security solutions.

**Below are quick links for you to follow the relevant steps:**&#x200B;

[Whitelist for Office 365](allow-list-for-microsoft-365.md)

[​​Whitelist for Google Workspace](allow-list-for-google-workspace.md)

[​​Whitelist for Exchange 2013/2016](allow-list-for-exchange-2013-2016.md)

​​[Whitelist in Security Solutions](allow-list-in-security-solutions.md)



Also note, you will need to ensure the Keepnet domains are whitelisted in other security solutions such as **Defender** and **ZScaler** ​who manage the security of URLs in the inbox and browser.
