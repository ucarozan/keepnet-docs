# Google: Direct Email Creation

## **Direct Email Creation** <a href="#direct-email-creation" id="direct-email-creation"></a>

**Direct Email Creation (DEC)** is a feature that connects to your O365 with a few required API permissions. This feature creates the phishing simulation email directly in the user’s inbox instead of sending the emails over SMTP protocol.**Key Benefits:**

1. Remove false positives that whitelisting tools cause when analyzing links.
2. Eradicate maintenance and challenges of whitelisting for the purpose of email delivery (you may need to whitelist in your URL protection solutions such as Defender or ZScaler)
3. Very simple and quick setup (can be completed in a couple of minutes!)

This page explains how to use the **Direct** **Email** **Creation** feature in **Google** **Workspace**. Please follow the steps below to set up DEC settings within your Google Workspace.

## Troubleshoot

If you test the DEC configuration and the test is not successful, please try the following options.&#x20;

* Please make sure the domain you selected in DEC settings is **Verified** in **the Allowed Domains** page. If it is not, please verify it.&#x20;
* Please ensure the domain you selected in DEC settings is used in the employee's email address as main domain in Google Workspace.
* Please try to launch a phishing campaign to the test emails with DEC settings via Campaign Manager. Then, go inside the campaign report and go to the **Sending** **Report** menu. You can see more technical information if you hover your mouse over the delivery **Error** status.
