#### **Step 2.**

On the first settings page, **Add-in Settings**, is where you can customise how the Phishing Reporter appears in your employees inbox including:

* Logo
* Button labels
* Messages users receive when reporting emails

#### **Step 3.**

Your **Email Settings** page is where you select who will be notified about suspicious emails and the email you want them to receive. You can add as many emails as you would like here.

#### **Step 4.**

**Proxy**: If users are accessing the internet through a proxy, you can enable the plugin to detect the proxy configuration of the computer where it will be installed.

**API**: If you require any changes to be made to the API settings, please let our support team know on support@keepnetlabs.com.

**Enterprise Vault**: When selected, the suspicious email can be searched in the user's backup emails during the investigation. (_Only for MSI phishing reporter add-in_)

#### **Step 5.**

The **Diagnostic Tool** provides information about the status of the add-in. For example, if the add-in has been disabled by a user, the **Diagnostic Tool** can be used to ensure automatic activation or make system admins aware.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Diagnostic Tool is designed only for use on Outlook Desktop add-in with the MSI extension. When the add-in is distributed over Office 365 or Google Workspace, it is automatically installed and active for all users.
{% endhint %}

**Step 6.**

You will then need to **Download** the add-in for the environment compatible with your setup. Once downloaded you can follow the Deployment steps.​ ​
