# 4. Setup Phishing Reporter

## What is the Phishing Reporter?

Phishing Reporter is an add-in that allows users to easily report a suspicious email to cyber security teams. Quick, comprehensive analysis and response can be provided when used in conjunction with the Incident Responder.&#x20;

**There are 2 options:**

* Integrate the Native Microsoft Reporter Button with Keepnet
  * Use your existing reporter button whilst capturing who is showing secure reporting behaviour across your phishing simulations
* Use our highly customisable Keepnet Reporter Button
  * Customise the language employees see when reporting and set up positive reinforcement messages for employees whilst still being able to redirect reported emails to your SOC team

We have a [Phishing Reporter Announcement email template](../../platform/phishing-reporter/phishing-reporter-deployment/phishing-reporter-announcement-email-template.md) you can use to share the key benefits and expectations of your employees using this tool.
