# 2. Add Target Users

Your Target Users are the people who will receive simulation emails, training emails or any other emails from the platform. They will not have a login to Keepnet or require any access to the platform.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Email addresses are required for all users even for our Vishing, Smishing and Callback tools to successfully verify your email domains
{% endhint %}

**⬇️ You have several options for adding target users:**&#x20;

* [**Manually Add Users**](add-users-via-csv.md)
* [**SCIM Integration**](add-users-via-scim/) **(most common:** add users from your identity management provider directly into Keepnet. Automatically add people who join your business and remove people who leav&#x65;**)**
* [**LDAP integration**](add-users-via-ldap.md)
* [**Add users via API**](add-users-via-api.md)

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend using an integration to ensure that new employees are automatically added and people who leave your business are automatically removed. This ensures reporting is as accurate as possible.
