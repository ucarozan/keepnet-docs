We collect Personal Data from you when you submit web forms or interact with our websites, for example by subscribing to a Keepnet blog, signing up for a webinar, subscribing to one of our services or requesting customer support. We may ask for your email address, first and last name, job title, and other similar business information. You are free to explore some of our websites without providing any Personal Data about yourself.&#x20;

Event Information

When you register for a Keepnet event, we collect information such as name, address, phone number, and email address.

If you give us payment information, we use it solely as authorized by you in accordance with this Privacy Policy.&#x20;

You may also provide payment information, such as a credit card number or bank account numbers, when purchasing products or services. We use secure third-party payment service providers to manage payment processing, which is collected through a secure payment process. &#x20;

Customer Testimonials&#x20;

We post customer testimonials and comments on our websites, which may contain Personal Data. We obtain each customer's consent via email or through other agreements between customers and Keepnet prior to posting the customer's name and testimonial.

#### b. Information We Process on Behalf of Customers When They Use the Subscription Service

Our products, or the Subscription Service, allow our customers to create and share training, simulation, and customer service content. When customers use our products, they may collect Personal Data such as first and last name, email address, physical address, phone number, or other information about you. We call the information that our customers submit or collect via the product ‘Customer Data’ under our [Customer Terms of Service](../../for-customers/customer-terms-of-service.md).

We do not control the content of our customers' webpages or the types of Personal Data that our customers may choose to collect or manage using the Subscription Service. We store our customers' information on our service providers' servers but process it as a processor under our customers’ instructions and in accordance with our [Customer Terms of Service](../../for-customers/customer-terms-of-service.md), which prohibit us from using the information except as necessary to provide and improve the Subscription Service and as required by law.\
Our customers control and are responsible for correcting, deleting or updating the information they process using the Subscription Service and for complying with any regulations or laws that require providing notice, disclosure, and/or obtaining consent prior to transferring the Personal Data to Keepnet for processing purposes.

#### c. Information We Collect and Process When You Use the Subscription Service

It is your responsibility to review any third party integrations you authorize. We may collect information about what types of integrations you use in your Keepnet account.

Any permission(s) granted by you, grants these third parties access to your data, which may include (but is not limited to) granting third party applications access to view, store, and modify your Keepnet account data. We are not responsible for the practices of third party integrations, so please carefully review the permissions you grant to third party applications.

Third Parties&#x20;

We may receive information from third party service providers, from related companies, and from our business and solution partners.

Personal Data from Different Sources

We may combine the personal information we collect from you with personal information we receive from other sources, such as third party providers of business information and publicly available sources (like social media platforms). This may include physical mail addresses, job titles, email addresses, phone numbers, IP addresses, and social media profiles. This helps us to update and improve our records, identify new customers, create more personalized advertising, suggest products and services that may interest you, deliver personalized communications and promote events. The collection of your Personal Data by these other third party providers is governed by the provider’s privacy policy.

Log Files&#x20;

Like most websites and technology services delivered over the Internet, we automatically collect and store information about your computer hardware and software when you visit our websites, use our products or services, or visit other sites or services that link to this Privacy Policy. This information can include your IP address, browser type, domain names, internet service provider (ISP), and the files viewed on our websites (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), the files viewed on our, or our customer’s websites (if those websites are hosted on Keepnet e.g. HTML pages or, graphics etc), your operating system, access times and referring website addresses.&#x20;

When you use the Subscription Service, we collect and store the categories of information listed above in logs in the following instances, subject to the customer’s implementation settings:

* When a Keepnet user logs into their account and accesses tools in the Keepnet Platform;
* When an individual visits a customer’s website, if the website is hosted by the Keepnet product; or

Buttons, tools, and content from other companies

Our websites may include features and widgets (such as the share and/or "like" button or interactive mini-programs) that run on our websites. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our sites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. These features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to these features. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy and other policies of the companies providing them.

We have implemented Google reCAPTCHA on certain products and services to prevent malicious software from engaging in abusive activities on our websites.

We may receive information about you from other companies that are owned or operated by Keepnet.

## 2. How We Use Personal Data

#### a. To Communicate with You About the Products and Services

We use the account information you provide to Keepnet when signing up for the Subscription Service and Trends services to send you transactional emails or in-app notification about billing, account management, and other administrative matters. We may also send you updates regarding our Customer Terms of Service or other legal agreements, and may also communicate with you about security incidents via email or in-app notification.&#x20;

We use your information to provide customer support, such as resolving technical issues you encounter and analyzing product outages or bugs.&#x20;

If you use the Keepnet mobile applications, we may send you push notifications from time to time in order to update you about events and promotions. If you no longer wish to receive such communications, you may turn them off at the device level.

#### b. To Provide the Subscription Service

We use your account information and Customer Data to provide the products or services to you. For example, we use the email address you provide when signing up for the product to create your user account, and we use your payment information to process payments for paid use of the Subscription Service. We also use this information to authenticate you when you log in and to provide customer support.

#### c. To Improve and Develop Our Products and Services

We collect usage data about how you or your users interact with our products and services. We use this data to develop and improve our products and services.  For example, we use usage data to assess trends and usage across the product to help us determine what new features or integrations our users may be interested in.&#x20;

We use Customer Data for machine learning that supports certain products and development of features and functionality with the Subscription Service and similar products and services. For example, machine learning helps power the business card scanner tool if you use our mobile apps and allows for easier imports of data into your Keepnet account. You may opt-out of having your Customer Data used for machine learning by emailing privacy@Keepnet.com.&#x20;

We may publish data about how our products or services are being used across our customer base. When we share statistical information externally in this way, the data will be aggregated and we will not identify individual users or customers. For example, we may publish blog posts on trends or insights into how users are interacting with our product.&#x20;

#### d. To Secure and Protect our Platform (including Products and Services) and Keepnet Users

We use your account information to investigate and help prevent security incidents. We may also use this information to meet legal requirements. We use your information to verify user accounts, new product sign-ups, and to detect and prevent product abuse. This includes enforcing our [Acceptable Use Policy](../../for-customers/acceptable-use-policy.md). &#x20;

We use log files to provide general statistics regarding use of the websites by you, including how you use our websites, what country you are logging in from (for analytics, export control and regulatory purposes) and to help improve the navigation experience. Your IP addresses are also collected and logged for security and debugging purposes, for example to track access patterns, investigate security events and incidents. For these purposes we do link this automatically-collected data to other personal data provided by you such as name, email address, address, and phone number.&#x20;

#### e. To Market and Promote the Subscription Service

We use the information you provide to Keepnet to market and promote the products, services, and other offerings. For example, we use the information, like your email or physical address, to send information or Keepnet content to you which we think may be of interest to you by post, email, or other means and send you marketing communications relating to our business.

You may opt out of receiving this promotional content by following the instructions contained in each communication that we send to you or by contacting us at privacy@keepnetlabs.com. If you unsubscribe from our marketing lists, we will continue to contact you regarding administrative matters, and to respond to your requests.

We may also reach out to you via telephone to ask about other Keepnet products or services you may be interested in. If you have a call scheduled with a Keepnet representative, we may record and transcribe the call. You will be notified prior to the call that the call is being recorded, and you will be offered an opportunity to opt-out of having the call recorded.

Where required by law, we will only send marketing communications with your consent. Otherwise, we will market and advertise our products and services on the basis of our legitimate business interests.

We receive information from third party service providers and other sources such as third party providers of business information and publicly available sources. We may receive and use this information from these service providers and other sources in combination with other information we collect through other means described in this Privacy Policy for the purposes of providing you with updates and an improved Subscription Service, like personalized communications, event promotion, and tailoring the websites or product to improve user experience.&#x20;

#### f. Other Purposes if We Obtain Your Consent

We share your data with third parties when you give us consent to do so.

#### g. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data (EEA and UK visitors only)&#x20;

If you are a website visitor located in the European Economic Area ("EEA") or United Kingdom ("UK"), Keepnet Ireland Limited is the data controller of your Personal Data. Keepnet's Data Protection Officer can be contacted via email at privacy@keepnetlabs.com.

Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described above will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect Personal Data from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal Data to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you.

If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Data). Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

## 3. How We Share Personal Data

#### a. Service Providers&#x20;

We may share Personal Data with our third party service providers to support our websites, products, and services. For example, we use service providers for data hosting, application development, marketing, sales support and customer support. We may need to share your information with service providers to provide information about products or services to you. Examples may include removing repetitive information from prospect lists, analyzing data or performing statistical analysis on your use of the Subscription Service or interactions on our websites, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, supplementing the information you provide us in order to provide you with better service, developing and improving the products or services, and providing customer service or support. These service providers are prohibited from using your Personal Data except for these purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. In all cases where we share your information in this way, we explicitly require the third party service providers to acknowledge and adhere to our privacy and data protection policies and standards.

#### b. Partners&#x20;

We may share data with trusted Keepnet partners to contact you based on your request to receive such communications, help us perform statistical analysis, provide sales support, or provide customer support. Partners are prohibited from using your Personal Data except for these purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your data.

We also partner with trusted third parties to provide you with co-marketing content that we think may be relevant to you. When you engage with these co-marketing partners, we will tell you who we are sharing data with, and provide a link to the co-marketing partner’s privacy policy so you can learn more about how to opt-out of the partner’s communications. These co-marketing partners are required to adhere to our privacy and data protection policies.

#### c. Corporate Events&#x20;

If we (or our assets) are acquired by another company, whether by merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or otherwise, that company would receive all information gathered by Keepnet on the websites and the Subscription Service. In this event, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website, of any change in ownership, uses of your Personal Data, and choices you may have regarding your Personal Data.

#### d. Public Forums

Our websites may offer publicly accessible message boards, blogs, and community forums (e.g. Keepnet Community and Connect.com). Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose any information through our public message boards, blogs, or forums (including profile information associated with the account you use to post the information) it may be read, collected and used by any member of the public who accesses these websites. Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after you terminate your account. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you may disclose in this way. We will correct or delete any information you have posted on the websites if you so request, as described in Section 7 "Your Privacy Rights and Choices" below. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to and why.

#### e. Compelled Disclosure&#x20;

We reserve the right to use or disclose your Personal Data if required by law or if we reasonably believe that use or disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or comply with a law, court order, or legal process. If you use the Subscription Service, Customer Data is considered Confidential Information and you should review the Confidentiality terms in the Customer Terms of Service for more information.&#x20;

This Privacy Policy will apply even if we transfer Personal Data to other countries. We have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your Personal Data will remain protected wherever it is transferred. When we share Personal Data of individuals in the European Economic Area ("EEA"), Switzerland or the United Kingdom ("UK") within and among Keepnet’s Affiliates, we rely upon the Standard Contractual Clauses (approved by the European Commission and Swiss authorities) and UK Addendum to the Standard Contractual Clauses (approved by the UK authorities) where required, as well as additional safeguards where appropriate (such as commercial industry standard secure encryption methods to protect customer data at rest and in transit, TLS for Keepnet hosted sites, web application firewall protection, and other appropriate contractual and organizational measures), as described more in detail [here](../../../resources/compliance.md).

#### b. International Transfers to Third Parties

Some of the third parties described in this Privacy Policy, which provide services to us under contract, are based in other countries that may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws to the country in which you reside. When we share Personal Data of individuals in the EEA, Switzerland or UK with third parties, we use a variety of legal mechanisms to safeguard the transfer including the European Commission-approved Data Privacy Framework Standard Contractual Clauses, as well as additional safeguards where appropriate. For transfers to or from the United Kingdom, we make use of the UK Addendum. For transfers to or from Canada, we make use of the standard contractual clauses. With respect to personal data received from or transferred to Canada, Keepnet is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. Please contact us if you need more information about the legal mechanisms we rely on to transfer personal data outside the EEA, Switzerland, Canada, and UK.

#### c. Data Privacy Framework Notice

Keepnet will remain liable under the DPF Principles if our agent processes your Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless Keepnet is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

Please note that under certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose your Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
