# Transparency Report

At Keepnet, we believe in fostering trust and openness with our stakeholders, including customers, employees, partners, and the public. As part of our commitment to protecting the privacy rights and information of our customers and users, we openly share our transparency report.&#x20;

**How Does Keepnet Respond to Requests?**&#x20;

We are transparent about how we handle data requests from government agencies and law enforcement. If Keepnet receives a request for user information from a government agency or law enforcement official from any jurisdiction, Keepnet will review the request with the legal team. Therefore, we will ensure that there is a valid legal basis for the request, before sharing any customer or user information.

**How Does Keepnet Report the Requests?**&#x20;

We report the requests that have been received, unless prohibited by law, in our Transparency Report.&#x20;

The Transparency Report is published on our site and updated annually. In our report, we provide as much relevant information as possible, including – when legally possible – the type of data requested, the requesting authority, the number of users impacted.
