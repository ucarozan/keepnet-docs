**PLEASE READ THESE CUSTOMER TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY.**

Our Customer Terms of Service is a contract that governs our customers' use of the Keepnet products and services. It consists of the following documents:

* [**Product Specific Terms**](product-specific-terms.md)**:** These include any additional terms that apply to your use of each of our product offerings, our consulting and other services, and third-party services.
* [**Jurisdiction Specific Terms**](jurisdiction-specific-terms.md)**:** Depending on your location, some of these jurisdiction-specific terms will apply to you. They’ll also explain which Keepnet entity you’re contracting with, and which laws will govern our relationship.
* [**Data Processing Agreement (DPA)**](data-processing-agreement.md)**:** This explains how we process your data and includes the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.

11.1  Amendment; No Waiver.

We may modify any part or all of the Agreement by posting a revised version at [https://doc.keepnetlabs.com/legal-hub](https://doc.keepnetlabs.com/legal-hub).  The revised version will become effective and binding the next business day after it is posted. We will provide you notice of this revision by email or in-app notification. &#x20;

If you do not agree with a modification to the Agreement, you must notify us in writing within thirty (30) days after we send notice of the revision. If you give us this notice, then your subscription will continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of the Agreement prior to modification until your next renewal date, after which the current terms posted at [https://doc.keepnetlabs.com/legal-hub](https://doc.keepnetlabs.com/legal-hub) will apply.  However, if we can no longer reasonably provide the subscription to you under the terms prior to modification (for example, if the modifications are required by law or result from general product changes), then the Agreement and/or affected Subscription Services will terminate upon our notice to you and we will promptly refund any prepaid but unused fees covering use of the Subscription Service after termination in accordance with the ‘Effect of Termination or Expiration’ provision of this Agreement.&#x20;

No delay in exercising any right or remedy or failure to object will be a waiver of such right or remedy or any other right or remedy. A waiver on one occasion will not be a waiver of any right or remedy on any future occasion.

Each party will use reasonable efforts to mitigate the effect of a force majeure event.

11.6 Severability.

THIS SECTION STATES OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY AND YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM PROVIDED FOR UNDER THIS SECTION.
