We strongly recommend retrieving your Customer Data prior to the end of your Subscription Term; for the Keepnet Subscription Services and Free Services, we will not provide you with any access to Customer Data after termination or expiration of your Subscription Term.

### 3.  KEEPNET SEATS&#x20;

Keepnet Seats facilitate streamlined access to Keepnet Subscription Services, featuring pricing options tailored to users. A "Seat" represents the specific type and level of access granted to target users for the Subscription Services. We provide a variety of seat options, each corresponding to different Subscription Services available. These options are detailed in our Product and Services Catalog, allowing you to choose the most appropriate access level and services for your needs.

#### Managing Seats and Target Users.&#x20;

System users, who manage the platform, are not classified as licensed or paid users and are not counted towards the subscription seats. Customers have the flexibility to add, edit, or delete system users at any time without incurring additional costs or needing Keepnet's approval. These users do not occupy a seat within the Subscription Services.

The Subscription Services are provided on a per-seat, subscription basis for target users—who are the actual users accessing the subscription services. Customers bear exclusive responsibility for managing access to the Subscription Services for their target users. The number of active target users granted access must not exceed the number of seats purchased. Should the number of active target users surpass the seats available, the customer must either purchase additional seats to cover the excess or reduce the number of active target users to match the number of purchased seats.

Re-allocation of seats among users is tightly regulated. While Keepnet prohibits the casual cycling of seats among the customer's staff, it allows for seat reassignment when a user's account is cancelled or removed due to employment termination or contract end, facilitating normal employee turnover without requiring Keepnet's prior written approval.

Keepnet reserves the right to monitor compliance with these terms. Upon Keepnet's request, customers agree to confirm their adherence to these guidelines. Additional seats may be added during the Subscription Term, aligned with the term's end date. Pricing for added seats will follow the original volume, level, and term discounts of the existing Subscription Term, valid until its conclusion. New rates may apply upon subscription renewal.

### 6. SERVICE UPTIME COMMITMENT

For the purposes of this 'Service Uptime Commitment' section, the following definitions will apply:

"Downtime" means a critical full outage/severe issue that constitutes a catastrophic problem causing complete inability to use the Subscription Service, excluding Free Services, across a significant portion of the production environment (e.g. crash or hang), resulting in production downtime and where there is no workaround or solution to the problem.

"Excluded" means the following: (i) unavailability caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including, without limitation, act of God, acts of government, emergencies, natural disasters, flood, fire, civil unrest, acts of terror, strikes or other labor problems (other than those involving our employees), or any other force majeure event or factors; (ii) any problems resulting from Customer's combining or merging the Subscription Service with any hardware or software not supplied by us or not identified by us in writing as compatible with the Subscription Service; (iii) interruptions or delays in providing the Subscription Service resulting from telecommunications or internet service provider failures outside of our datacenter as measured by our third party website availability monitoring provider; (iv) any interruption or unavailability resulting from the misuse, improper use, alteration, or damage of the Subscription Service; and (v) unavailability while we perform maintenance on the Subscription Service when necessary, in Keepnet’s sole, reasonable discretion.

"Service Uptime" means (total hours in calendar month - Excluded duration  - Downtime duration) / (total hours in calendar month - Excluded duration  ) x 100% = Service Uptime.

We will use commercially reasonable efforts to meet a Service Uptime of 99.00% for our Subscription Service in a given calendar month. All availability calculations will be based on our system records. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, as Customer's sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet Service Uptime commitments, in the event there are two (2) or more consecutive calendar months during which the Service Uptime falls below 99.00% in a given calendar month, Customer will be entitled to receive a credit equal to the pro-rated amount of fees applicable to the downtime as measured within two (2) or more consecutive calendar months during which the Service Uptime fell below 99.00%.  The credit will be applied against an invoice or charge for the following renewal Subscription Term, provided Customer requests such credit within twenty (20) days of the end of the relevant calendar month in which Keepnet did not meet the Service Uptime of 99.00%. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement or this section, this 'Service Uptime Commitment' section does not apply to our Free Services.&#x20;
