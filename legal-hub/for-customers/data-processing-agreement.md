**c. Security**. You are responsible for independently determining whether the data security provided for in the Subscription Service adequately meets your obligations under applicable Data Protection Laws. You are also responsible for your secure use of the Subscription Service, including protecting the security of Personal Data in transit to and from the Subscription Service (including to securely backup or encrypt any such Personal Data).

## 3. Keepnet Obligations

**a. Compliance with Instructions.** We will only Process Personal Data for the purposes described in this DPA or as otherwise agreed within the scope of your lawful Instructions, except where and to the extent otherwise required by applicable law. We are not responsible for compliance with any Data Protection Laws applicable to you or your industry that are not generally applicable to us.

**b. Conflict of Laws.** If we become aware that we cannot Process Personal Data in accordance with your Instructions due to a legal requirement under any applicable law, we will (i) promptly notify you of that legal requirement to the extent permitted by the applicable law; and (ii) where necessary, cease all Processing (other than merely storing and maintaining the security of the affected Personal Data) until such time as you issue new Instructions with which we are able to comply. If this provision is invoked, we will not be liable to you under the Agreement for any failure to perform the applicable Subscription Services until such time as you issue new lawful Instructions with regard to the Processing.

**c. Security.** We will implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data from Personal Data Breaches, as described under Annex 2 to this DPA ("Security Measures"). Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, we may modify or update the Security Measures at our discretion provided that such modification or update does not result in a material degradation in the protection offered by the Security Measures.

**d. Confidentiality.** We will ensure that any personnel whom we authorize to Process Personal Data on our behalf is subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations (whether a contractual or statutory duty) with respect to that Personal Data.

**e. Personal Data Breaches.** We will notify you without undue delay after we become aware of any Personal Data Breach and will provide timely information relating to the Personal Data Breach as it becomes known or reasonably requested by you. At your request, we will promptly provide you with such reasonable assistance as necessary to enable you to notify relevant Personal Data Breaches to competent authorities and/or affected Data Subjects, if you are required to do so under Data Protection Laws.

**f. Deletion or Return of Personal Data**. We will delete or return all Customer Data, including Personal Data (including copies thereof) Processed pursuant to this DPA, on termination or expiration of your Subscription Service in accordance with the procedures set out in our [Product Specific Terms](product-specific-terms.md). This term will apply except where we are required by applicable law to retain some or all of the Customer Data, or where we have archived Customer Data on back-up systems, which data we will securely isolate and protect from any further Processing and delete in accordance with our deletion practices. You may request the deletion of your Keepnet account after expiration or termination of your subscription by sending a request using our privacy policy at https://keepnetlabs.com/privacy-policy.\
\
If you need help retrieving your Customer Data during the Subscription Term, we will provide reasonable assistance to you, at your cost, and in accordance with the ‘Confidentiality’ section of the [Terms\&Conditions](https://doc.keepnetlabs.com/legal-hub/for-everyone/website/terms-of-use).

## 4. Data Subject Requests

The Subscription Service provides you with a number of controls that you can use to retrieve, correct, delete or restrict Personal Data, which you can use to assist it in connection with its obligations under Data Protection Laws, including your obligations relating to responding to requests from Data Subjects to exercise their rights under applicable Data Protection Laws ("Data Subject Requests").

To the extent that you are unable to independently address a Data Subject Request through the Subscription Service, then upon your written request we will provide reasonable assistance to you to respond to any Data Subject Requests or requests from data protection authorities relating to the Processing of Personal Data under the Agreement. You will reimburse us for the commercially reasonable costs arising from this assistance.

If a Data Subject Request or other communication regarding the Processing of Personal Data under the Agreement is made directly to us, we will promptly inform you and will advise the Data Subject to submit their request to you. You will be solely responsible for responding substantively to any such Data Subject Requests or communications involving Personal Data.

## 5. Sub-Processors

You agree we may engage Sub-Processors to Process Personal Data on your behalf, and we do so in three ways. First, we may engage Sub-Processors to assist us with hosting and infrastructure. Second, we may engage with Sub-Processors to support product features and integrations. Third, we may engage with Keepnet Affiliates as Sub-Processors for service and support. Some Sub-Processors will apply to you as default, and some Sub-Processors will apply only if you opt-in.

We have currently appointed, as Sub-Processors, the third parties and Keepnet Affiliates listed in Annex 3 to this DPA.

We will give you the opportunity to object to the engagement of new Sub-Processors on reasonable grounds relating to the protection of Personal Data within 30 days of notifying you. If you do notify us of such an objection, the parties will discuss your concerns in good faith with a view to achieving a commercially reasonable resolution. If no such resolution can be reached, we will, at our sole discretion, either not appoint the new Sub-Processor, or permit you to suspend or terminate the affected Subscription Service in accordance with the termination provisions of the Agreement without liability to either party (but without prejudice to any fees incurred by you prior to suspension or termination).

Where we engage Sub-Processors, we will impose data protection terms on the Sub- Processors that provide at least the same level of protection for Personal Data as those in this DPA, to the extent applicable to the nature of the services provided by such Sub- Processors. We will remain responsible for each Sub-Processor’s compliance with the obligations of this DPA and for any acts or omissions of such Sub-Processor that cause us to breach any of its obligations under this DPA.

## 6. Data Transfers

You acknowledge and agree that we may access and Process Personal Data on a global basis as necessary to provide the Subscription Service in accordance with the Agreement, and in particular that Personal Data may be transferred to and Processed by Keepnet, Inc. in the United States and to other jurisdictions where Keepnet Affiliates and Sub-Processors have operations. Wherever Personal Data is transferred outside its country of origin, each party will ensure such transfers are made in compliance with the requirements of Data Protection Laws.

## 7. Demonstration of Compliance

We will make all information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with this DPA available to you and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections conducted by you or your auditor in order to assess compliance with this DPA, where required by applicable law. You acknowledge and agree that you will exercise your audit rights under this DPA by instructing us to comply with the audit measures described in this 'Demonstration of Compliance' section. You acknowledge that the Subscription Service is hosted by our hosting Sub-Processors who maintain independently validated security programs (including SOC 2 and ISO 27001) and that our systems are audited annually as part of ISO 27001 compliance and regularly tested by independent third party penetration testing firms. Upon request, we will supply (on a confidential basis) our ISO 27001 report and summary copies of our penetration testing report(s) to you so that you can verify our compliance with this DPA. You may download copies of these documents from Keepnet’s Platform Security website at [doc.keepnetlabs.com](https://doc.keepnetlabs.com). Further, at your written request, we will provide written responses (on a confidential basis) to all reasonable requests for information made by you necessary to confirm our compliance with this DPA, provided that you will not exercise this right more than once per calendar year unless you have reasonable grounds to suspect non-compliance with the DPA.

**e. Transfer Mechanisms for Data Transfers.**

(A) Keepnet will not transfer European Data to any country or recipient not recognized as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Data (within the meaning of applicable European Data Protection Laws), unless it first takes all such measures as are necessary to ensure the transfer is in compliance with applicable European Data Protection Laws. Such measures may include (without limitation) (i) transferring such data to a recipient that is covered by a suitable framework or other legally adequate transfer mechanism recognized by the relevant authorities or courts as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Data, including the Data Privacy Framework; (ii) to a recipient that has achieved binding corporate rules authorization in accordance with European Data Protection Laws; or (iii) to a recipient that has executed the Standard Contractual Clauses; in each case as adopted or approved in accordance with applicable European Data Protection Laws.

(1) Data Privacy Framework. Keepnet, Inc. will use the Data Privacy Framework to lawfully receive European Data in the United States and ensure that it provides at least the same level of protection to such European Data as is required by the Data Privacy Framework Principles and will let you know if it is unable to comply with this requirement.

(2) Standard Contractual Clauses. If European Data Protection Laws require that appropriate safeguards are put in place (for example, if the Data Privacy Framework does not cover the transfer to Keepnet, Inc. and/or the Data Privacy Framework is invalidated), the Standard Contractual Clauses will be incorporated by reference and form part of the Agreement as follows:

(a) In relation to European Data that is subject to the GDPR (i) Customer is the "data exporter" and Keepnet, Inc. is the "data importer"; (ii) the Module Two terms apply to the extent the Customer is a Controller of European Data and the Module Three terms apply to the extent the Customer is a Processor of European Data; (iii) in Clause 7, the optional docking clause applies; (iv) in Clause 9, Option 2 applies and changes to Sub-Processors will be notified in accordance with the ‘Sub-Processors’ section of this DPA; (v) in Clause 11, the optional language is deleted; (vi) in Clauses 17 and 18, the parties agree that the governing law and forum for disputes for the Standard Contractual Clauses will be determined in accordance with the 'Contracting Entity; Applicable Law; Notice’ section of the Jurisdiction Specific Terms or, if such section does not specify an EU Member State, the Republic of Ireland (without reference to conflicts of law principles); (vii) the Annexes of the Standard Contractual Clauses will be deemed completed with the information set out in the Annexes of this DPA; (viii) the supervisory authority that will act as competent supervisory authority will be determined in accordance with GDPR; and (ix) if and to the extent the Standard Contractual Clauses conflict with any provision of this DPA the Standard Contractual Clauses will prevail to the extent of such conflict.

(c) In relation to European Data that is subject to the Swiss DPA, the Standard Contractual Clauses will apply in accordance with sub-section (a) and the following modifications (i) references to "Regulation (EU) 2016/679" will be interpreted as references to the Swiss DPA; (ii) references to "EU", "Union" and "Member State law" will be interpreted as references to Swiss law; and (iii) references to the "competent supervisory authority" and "competent courts" will be replaced with the "the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner " and the "relevant courts in Switzerland".

(d) You agree that by complying with our obligations under the 'Sub-Processors' section of this DPA, Keepnet, Inc. fulfills its obligations under Section 9 of the Standard Contractual Clauses. For the purposes of Clause 9(c) of the Standard Contractual Clauses, you acknowledge that we may be restricted from disclosing Sub-Processor agreements but we will use reasonable efforts to require any Sub-Processor we appoint to permit it to disclose the Sub-Processor agreement to you and will provide (on a confidential basis) all information we reasonably can. You also acknowledge and agree that you will exercise your audit rights under Clause 8.9 of the Standard Contractual Clauses by instructing us to comply with the measures described in the 'Demonstration of Compliance' section of this DPA.\
\
(e) Where the Keepnet contracting entity under the Agreement is not Keepnet, Inc., such contracting entity (not Keepnet, Inc.) will remain fully and solely responsible and liable to you for the performance of the Standard Contractual Clauses by Keepnet, Inc., and you will direct any instructions, claims or enquiries in relation to the Standard Contractual Clauses to such contracting entity. If Keepnet cannot comply with its obligations under the Standard Contractual Clauses or is breach of any warranties under the Standard Contractual Clauses or UK Addendum (as applicable) for any reason, and you intend to suspend the transfer of European Data to Keepnet or terminate the Standard Contractual Clauses, or UK Addendum, you agree to provide us with reasonable notice to enable us to cure such non-compliance and reasonably cooperate with us to identify what additional safeguards, if any, may be implemented to remedy such non-compliance. If we have not or cannot cure the non- compliance, you may suspend or terminate the affected part of the Subscription Service in accordance with the Agreement without liability to either party (but without prejudice to any fees you have incurred prior to such suspension or termination).

**(C) Alternative Transfer Mechanism.** In the event that Keepnet is required to adopt an alternative transfer mechanism for European Data, in addition to or other than the mechanisms described in sub-section (B) above, such alternative transfer mechanism will apply automatically instead of the mechanisms described in this DPA (but only to the extent such alternative transfer mechanism complies with European Data Protection Laws), and you agree to execute such other documents or take such action as may be reasonably necessary to give legal effect such alternative transfer mechanism.

The authorization model in each of our products is designed to ensure that only the appropriately assigned individuals can access relevant features, views, and customization options. Authorization to data sets is performed through validating the user’s permissions against the attributes associated with each data set.

Application Programming Interface (API) access: Public product APIs may be accessed using an API key or through Oauth authorization.

ii) **Preventing Unauthorized Product Use**

We implement industry standard access controls and detection capabilities for the internal networks that support its products.

Access controls: Network access control mechanisms are designed to prevent network traffic using unauthorized protocols from reaching the product infrastructure. The technical measures implemented differ between infrastructure providers and include Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) implementations, security group assignment, and traditional firewall rules.

Intrusion detection and prevention: We implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) solution to protect hosted customer websites and other internet-accessible applications. The WAF is designed to identify and prevent attacks against publicly available network services.

Static code analysis: Code stored in our source code repositories is checked for best practices and identifiable software flaws using automated tooling.

Penetration testing: We maintain relationships with industry-recognized penetration testing service providers for penetration testing of both the Keepnet web application and internal corporate network infrastructure at least annually. The intent of these penetration tests is to identify security vulnerabilities and mitigate the risk and business impact they pose to the in-scope systems.

Bug bounty: A bug bounty program invites and incentivizes independent security researchers to ethically discover and disclose security flaws. We implement a bug bounty program in an effort to widen the available opportunities to engage with the security community and improve the product defenses against sophisticated attacks.

iii) Limitations of Privilege & Authorization Requirements

Product access: A subset of our employees have access to the products and to customer data via controlled interfaces. The intent of providing access to a subset of employees is to provide effective customer support, product development and research, to troubleshoot potential problems, to detect and respond to security incidents and implement data security. Access is enabled through “just in time” (JITA) requests for access; all such requests are logged. Employees are granted access by role, and reviews of high risk privilege grants are initiated daily. Administrative or high risk access permissions are reviewed at least once every six months.

Background checks: Where permitted by applicable law, Keepnet employees undergo a third-party background or reference check. In the United States, employment offers are contingent upon the results of a third-party background check. All Keepnet employees are required to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with company guidelines, non-disclosure requirements, and ethical standards.

**b) Transmission Control**

In-transit: We require HTTPS encryption (also referred to as SSL or TLS) on all login interfaces and for free on every customer site hosted on the Keepnet products. Our HTTPS implementation uses industry standard algorithms and certificates.

At-rest: We store user passwords following policies that follow industry standard practices for security. We have implemented technologies to ensure that stored data is encrypted at rest.

**c) Input Control**

Detection: We designed our infrastructure to log extensive information about the system behavior, traffic received, system authentication, and other application requests. Internal systems aggregate log data and alert appropriate employees of malicious, unintended, or anomalous activities. Our personnel, including security, operations, and support personnel, are responsive to known incidents.

Response and tracking: We maintain a record of known security incidents that includes description, dates and times of relevant activities, and incident disposition. Suspected and confirmed security incidents are investigated by security, operations, or support personnel; and appropriate resolution steps are identified and documented. For any confirmed incidents, we will take appropriate steps to minimize product and Customer damage or unauthorized disclosure. Notification to you will be in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.

terms of the Agreement.

**d) Availability Control**

Infrastructure availability: The infrastructure providers use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure a minimum of 99.95% uptime. The providers maintain a minimum of N+1 redundancy to power, network, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) services.

Fault tolerance: Backup and replication strategies are designed to ensure redundancy and fail-over protections during a significant processing failure. Customer data is backed up to multiple durable data stores and replicated across multiple availability zones.

Online replicas and backups: Where feasible, production databases are designed to replicate data between no less than 1 primary and 1 secondary database. All databases are backed up and maintained using at least industry standard methods.

Disaster Recovery Plans: We maintain and regularly test disaster recovery plans to help ensure availability of information following interruption to, or failure of, critical business processes.

Our products are designed to ensure redundancy and seamless failover. The server instances that support the products are also architected with a goal to prevent single points of failure. This design assists our operations in maintaining and updating the product applications and backend while limiting downtime.
